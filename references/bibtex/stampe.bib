Nominal compounds include (1) copulatives, either Noun + Noun, or Noun + Echo (e.g. /Gka/ in /Gku-Gka/ 'tigers and so forth'), and (2) determinatives, both dependent (Noun + Noun, either modifier-first e.g. /raja-Dua/ 'king's housé, or modifier-last, e.g. /hEik'-luk'/ 'earwax', lit.

They have special forms with the accusative and genitive suffixes, as personal affixes with kinterms, and as subject affixes with verbs; in the latter forms, number is syncretized in the first and third persons. The numerals 1,...,10 take classifier suffixes before nouns (see above). Complex numerals are decimal to 19 and decimal-vigesimal to 399.

    stampenote = {[Reviewed: Shafer??; ??.] – Despite its modest title, and its emphasis on Kharia and the Munda languages, the most ambitious comparative study of the Austroasiatic languages as a whole, drawing on virtually every Austroasiatic source known in the fifties to establish proto-Munda and proto-Austroasiatic phonology and lexicon. It is a great misfortune that the data then available on Koraput Munda languages was so slight or misleading; relying on Ramamurti's erroneous presentation of Sora as having short vs long vowel systems, Pinnow projected this error from Sora to proto-Austroasiatic. Otherwise, his reconstructions seem in the main to stand up. The Introduction (1-26) lists the languages, briefly surveys the history of comparisons, and surveys their collective systems of word-formation and compounding. Part 1 (27-68) surveys the phonemic systems of the Munda languages (except Gta', which was not known then); Nahali; and the main Mon-Khmer languages (Mon, Khmer, Bahnar, Stieng, Chrau, Sre^); Palaung and Lawa; Khasi; Nicobarese; and the Malakka languages Semang and Sakai. Part 2, Vocalism (69-196), and part 3, Consonantism (197-428), survey the proto-phonemes, providing several hundred sets of cognates and semi-cognates which, thanks to full word-indexes (490-514), represent the fullest comparative Austroasiatic dictionary to date. To provide for the effects of occasional vowel harmony, the presentation of each proto-phoneme is divided up according to its positions in a (C)V(C) or (C)V(C)(C)V(C) word structure frame. Part 4 treats accent and intonation (429-448), and part 5, syllable and word structure.

They will not admit any connexion with them; but, as their language is almost identical, such gainsaying cannot be permitted them. They are called Kerang Kāpu from the circumstance of their women weaving cloths, which they weave from the fibre of a jungle shrub called Kerang (Calotropis gigantea)." Their numeral system is given: "Moi, Umbar, Jugi, O, Malloi, Turu, Gū, Tammar, Santing, Goa, and for eleven...they prefix the word Go, e.g. Gommoi, Gombāro, etc." Thurston, following W. Francis, identifies these numerals as Bonda Poraja (Remo; see the note on Thurston 1909 under Remo), but in the opinion of the editor of this bibliography they are Gta'; if they are, these are the earliest forms recorded in the language},

    abstract = {Babuyan Claro is a small island in northern Philippines, home to a dynamic multilingual community of speakers proficient in at least three languages, namely Ibatan, the local language, Ilokano, the regional lingua franca, and Filipino, the national language. Ibatan, the smallest of the three, has emerged out of an intense and complex contact setting in Babuyan Claro characterized by a kind of egalitarian multilingualism, but its less privileged position vis-à-vis Ilokano and Filipino at present has led to changing patterns of multilingualism across generations, driven by interacting social, political, and cultural changes. Currently, language choices and uses among the first-language and second-language speakers of Ibatan reflect how speakers form networks of interaction across the island. That is, speakers strongly tied to particular networks reflect greater affinity towards Ibatan, whereas those tied to other networks show stronger affinity towards Ilokano. The multilingual landscape of Babuyan Claro is one that clearly demonstrates not only change, but also fragility, where the effect of extra-linguistic pressures on the language ecology of the island has become more and more pronounced as the community has become further integrated into the modern nation state.},

Following steps for a systematic review, closer scrutiny of these publications has revealed the existence of four distinct vowel inventories and five distinct consonant inventories of this language. As a result, a descriptive-analytical study was devised aiming to understand the reasons for such divergent descriptions, and to decide which of these inventories is more representative of Zo’é. In case all lack adequacy, our aim is to provide a revised, updated analysis. Currently, the team of researchers awaits permission from the Brazilian government to visit the Zo’é Indigenous Land to present the research proposal to community leaders and upon agreement start the process of data collection. Meantime, data collected in encounters with the Zo’é people in the 1980s and 1990s are being explored.},

That being said, speakers from both communities consider themselves as two separate ethnic groups, and there are several salient lexical and morphosyntactic differences between Gorwaa and Iraqw. This paper provides an overview of the larger context in which Gorwaa is spoken. Section 2 sketches the history of its speaker community. Section 3 outlines the relationships (both genetic and areal) that exist between Gorwaa and other languages in the area. Section 4 provides details on language use and language attitudes (including speaker numbers, language vitality, and how speakers perceive Gorwaa).

Little was known about Malua until linguistic research was initiated with the communities in 2012. In this paper, ethnographic observations, linguistic field notes, and language attitude interviews are reported to build up a picture of the Malua language in context. The two Malua communities converted to Seventh Day Adventism some decades ago, and today blend traditional and modern ways of living. While relying on forest resources for shelter and fuel, and growing most of their own food, the Malua people also participate in market gardening and cash-cropping, and make use of modern building materials, textiles, and store-bought foods. Interviewees outlined positive attitudes towards the language, an appreciation of its intrinsic value, and a desire to see the language and associated traditional knowledge included in formal education. However, the language is under threat due to the increasing use of Bislama (Melanesian Pidgin).

This paper provides an overview of the Syuba language and the community of Syuba speakers.

I then look at the relationship of Syuba to Yolmo and other Tibetic varieties (Section 3) as well as the current state of Syuba language use (Section 4). I then outline the contemporary linguistic neighbourhood of the Syuba in Ramechhap (Section 5). This is followed by a discussion of the use of the names Syuba and Kagate by this community (Section 6) and an overview of key literature on Syuba (Section 7).

    abstract = {Julut was originally spoken in the Nuba Mountains, in the south of Sudan, South Kordofan. Together with Tima and Katla, it forms the Katlaic subgroup, which belongs to the Niger-Congo phylum. Greenberg (1963) proposed that Katlaic be subsumed under Niger-Congo’s Kordofanian branch. The existence of Kordofanian as such is questioned by different linguists today (Dimmendaal 2009, Güldemann 2018). Speaker populations are difficult to estimate due to limited information from the government as well as country-internal displacements as a result of economic pressure and civil war (Human Rights Watch 2012). Julut language documentation and description was the focus of the author’s PhD project from 2014 to 2020. The language data was collected during five field trips of roughly ten months’ work altogether. This paper gives a brief overview of the location of the Julut villages, the social situation of the communities, prior research, and the current investigation on Julut. مستخلص تُستخدم لغة جُلُد في الأصل في جبال النوبة بجنوب كردفان في جنوب السودان. وتشكل مع لغتي تيما وكتلا فرع الكتالايك، الذيينتمي الى عائلة النيجر كونغو. وقد صنف قرين بيرج (1963) فرع الكاتالايك تحت فرع اللغات الكردفانية في داخل عائلةالنيجركونغو، غيرأن وجود فرع اللغات الكرفانية أصبح اليوم موضع تساؤل بين مختلف اللغويين (ديمندال 2009، جولدامانومن الصعب تحديد عدد المتحدثين باللغة وذلك لشح المعلومات الرسمية، بالإضافة الى النزوح الداخلي في البلاد بسبب.(⁧2018الوضع الاقتصادي والحرب الأهلية (هيومان رايتس وتش 2012). كان التوصيف والتوثيق للغة جُلُد محور مشروع الدكتوراهالذي قامت به الباحثة في الفترة من (2014–2020). تقدم هذه الورقة لمحة موجزة عن موقع قرى جُلُد، والوضع الاجتماعي.للمجتمعات وعن الدراسات السابقة والحالية في لغة جُلُد},

A’ingae reflects the history of the Cofán migration, showing a mixture of typical Andean and Amazonian features (AnderBois et al. 2019). The language is relatively vital in Ecuador and severely endangered in Colombia. Illegal mining operations and poaching have exerted ecological and economic pressures on the Cofán, putting their way of life in danger. There is little support for the language outside of traditional communities. Despite the challenges, language attitudes surrounding A’ingae are uniformly positive.

    abstract = {Paicî, a Central-Eastern Oceanic language of the South Pacific, is a member of the Central subgroup of Northern Mainland languages of New Caledonia. Paicî is a tone language, which is unusual for Oceania, although less so for mainland New Caledonia. Spoken by around 6,500 people, it is one of the most vital of the approximately 30 Kanak (New Caledonia Melanesian) languages and is used at various levels of education. Nevertheless, like all mainland New Caledonian languages, it is under severe threat from French, the language of colonization. Increasing numbers of children are growing up with French as their dominant language. Colonization has also resulted in the erosion of some traditional cultural practices. General surveys of New Caledonian languages between the 1940s and early 1970s included early documentation of some aspects of Paicî. The French linguist J.-C. Rivierre produced a dictionary (1983) and examined tone (1974), research subsequently furthered by F. Lionnet (2019, 2022). Substantial collections of Paicî texts have been published by Rivierre and others since the 1970s. However, a detailed examination of its morphosyntax has not yet been undertaken. To fill this void, one of the authors of the present article has begun Ph.D. research on the topic; the other is working on a pedagogical grammar. Résumé Le paicî, langue du groupe océanien du sud, est membre du sous-groupe central des langues du nord de la Grande Terre de la Nouvelle-Calédonie (Pacifique du Sud). C’est une langue tonale, chose rare en Océanie (bien que pas unique en Nouvelle-Calédonie). Parlée par environ 6 500 personnes et utilisée dans l’éducation primaire et secondaire, elle se trouve parmi les langues qui se portent le mieux de la trentaine de langues néo-calédoniennes. Comme les autres langues du pays, elle est néanmoins gravement menacée par le français, la langue colonisatrice, qui devient la langue dominante pour un nombre croissant d’enfants. La colonisation a également entraîné l’érosion de certaines pratiques culturelles traditionnelles. Des recherches générales sur les langues néo-calédoniennes des années 1940 au début des années 1970 fournissent quelques renseignements sur le paicî. Par la suite, le linguiste J.-C. Rivierre a publié un dictionnaire (1983). Son étude de la tonalité du paicî (1974) est renforcée par Lionnet (2019, 2022). Des recueils importants de textes paicî ont été publiés par Rivierre et d’autres depuis les années 1970. L’examen détaillé de la morphosyntaxe du paicî reste à faire. Pour combler ce vide, l’un des auteurs du présent article a entamé un projet de recherche doctorale ; l’autre entreprend une grammaire pédagogique.

Many of the languages are spoken in the Sino-Tibetan frontier region: a large, complex, and diverse transitional region between Tibetan and Chinese cultural realms. Numerous communities with various and complex inter-connections during different historical periods have fostered great degrees of linguistic diversity in this region. Documentation of these languages has historically been a low priority, for a variety of reasons, including physical accessibility to these communities, recognition of the languages at local and state levels, and so on. This paper is a step forward in recognizing and describing the region’s minority languages and collating information on the existing work on these languages, with the aim of supporting their maintenance and revitalization, and providing data for further research and applied work.

Speakers belong to multiple ethnic groups and live in cities as well as rural and remote rainforest communities. The presence of a Quechuan language in the north-western Amazon has incited much debate about the ethno-linguistic history of the area; however, more documentary and descriptive work of the language is needed to better understand its past. Description of the language thorough in certain topics but not detailed enough in others. While there are thousands of speakers, Northern Pastaza Kichwa is at great risk of becoming critically endangered in a short time due to a lack of intergenerational transmission.},

The younger generations are no longer learning Ikema as a first language, and it is very likely that it will disappear in a few decades.

It is mentioned in comparative grammatical texts, but only in the context of other languages of upper Kinnaur. Sunam is linked to Bunan, spoken in the Lahaul valley. The language is employed by the upper caste community in Sunnam, where Sumcho, Hindi, and Kinnauri are also in use. Since 1990 Sunnam has undergone many changes in cultural, economic, and physical demography due to the construction of roads and the building of schools, where Hindi is the only medium of instruction. Although, the Sunam language is actively used in the community, Hindi is increasingly present in many domains of daily use.},

The language is acquired by children and also taught at local schools in the valleys but there is ongoing language shift to Khowar and other neighboring languages (see Torwali, this volume). The community members are very active in the learning, teaching, and preservation of their language. It is used in day-to-day conversation, marriage and funeral ceremonies, and annual festivals. There are two main dialect clusters of Kalasha: Northern (spoken in Birir, Bumburet, and Rumbur valleys) and Southern (Jinjiret and Urtsun valleys). Recent years have seen an upsurge in the documentation of Kalasha, particularly from a purely linguistic perspective. The authors are involved in the phonetic and phonological documentation of Kalasha dialects spoken in Birir, Bumburet, and Rumbur valleys and developing tools for the automatic segmentation of the stories, narratives, and other spontaneous speech data.},

According to Morey (2005), this term comes from written Burmese hyam, which is the source of the word pronounced ‘Shan’ in English. The Tai Aton live in small villages in the state of Assam and the names of their villages are directly translatable into modern Thai, as both sound and meaning correspond. The language belongs to the Southwestern branch of Tai, within the Tai-Kadai language family. The Aiton are multilingual, and can speak Tai, Assamese, English, and Hindi. They speak Aiton within the family and among community members, and generally use Assamese with others. Hakasam (2009) discusses the life style and the language system of Aiton. The Aiton people are very conscious about their language, culture and traditions. They are very small in number compared to the larger, dominating communities of the state. They try to pass on their culture and tradition to their younger generations. Tai Aiton can be considered a endangered language, according to the endangerment ...},

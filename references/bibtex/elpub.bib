    abstract = {San Sebastián del Monte Mixtec is an Otomanguean language spoken by approximately 1,526 people in Oaxaca, Mexico. It is still used in everyday interactions, but differs in according to age, and many people in the town are now bilingual in Spanish and Mixtec. In this article we present linguistic, demographic, and cultural information on the community. We also report basic information about the language, the work done up to today in language documentation, and language revitalization.},

    abstract = {Wajãpi is the name of a Tupi-Guarani language spoken by approximately 2,000 individuals in a region straddling the border between Brazil and French Guiana. The language is spoken, with an uncertain amount of dialectal differentiation, by all members of the group. Wajãpi speakers used to be found over a wide region of northeastern Amazonia, scattered over the headwaters of many different rivers. However, recent movements have led to population concentrations in the Upper and Middle Oyapock centers of Ytuwasu and Camopi in French Guiana, and in the Wajãpi Indigenous Reservation in Brazil. Most of the published research on the language has focused on the Oyapock varieties, but the ongoing research reported on here is bringing to light a number of interesting phonological and morphosyntactic features of the Amapari Wajãpi variety spoken in Brazil.},

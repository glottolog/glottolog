	abstract = {Aadhaar, India’s biometric-based ID, has been widely discussed since its inception in 2008-2009: from Aadhaar’s widest reach in enrolling majority of India’s 1.31 billion population, to the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, to the exclusion of marginalized communities and other human rights issues, and topics related to privacy, security and data protection. Through documentary research for the film “Marginalized Aadhaar”, Subhashish Panigrahi has investigated mostly three main areas. First: how lack of access to information - both before Aadhaar enrollment and during its implementation - has excluded marginalized groups. Key marginalisation factors include socio-ethnic, linguistic, economic and gender issues. Second: how the Aadhaar ecosystem has led to a violation of human rights and digital rights (human rights in digital environments). Several rights advocates and researchers both from India and elsewhere who have investigated ID systems, disability, linguistic issues and Free/Libre and Open Source software have covered many aspects related to this issue while elaborating further on how the Aadhaar project changed its course from an identity project to a mass identification/surveillance programme. Third: how the lack of openness and transparency are linked, and lead to the building of technological tools of mass exclusion.},

	abstract = {Ilham Nurwansah's passion of archiving and even reviving Sundanese culture did not stop at carving "Karinding", a musical instrument made of bamboo. A Sundanese saying goes -- "language is the identity of [a] nation" (Sundanese: asa téh cicirén bangsa"). The colonization era was complicated for Indonesia -- a country with 700 languages -- as it is hard to tell how it influenced the Sundanese language and culture. Ilham Nurwansah is on a mission to digitize old Sundanese-language (spoken by over 35 million people) text, and share encyclopedic information through the Sundanese Wikipedia. When not digitizing old Sundanese palm leaf manuscripts, he carves bamboo and palm and plays Karinding, a lamellophone instrument similar to jew's harp that originated from West Java and Banten in Indonesia. Made from different kinds of local bamboo varieties and midribs of palm trees, the sound of Karinding is "robotic" as Nurwansah's explains. This short documentary has a narration and performance by Nurwansah that was recorded by Subhashish Panigrahi at the T-Centralen station in Stockholm, Sweden during Wikimania 2019.},

	abstract = {No community can express the pain of losing an elder, especially when she was the last fluent speaker of their language. Gyani Maiya Sen-Kusunda died on January 25, 2020 in Kulmor village of Dang district in western Nepal, a year and half before this documentary was filmed. From leaving behind the life of a nomad to getting married to a non-nomad to raising a family that could not speak her language, Sen-Kusunda wished that the Kusunda language is taught to the newer generation. In her own words, "now none of the Mihaqs (Kusunda people) speak the language. The girls have got married and have left for the villages. Boys are getting married in villages. We left our language and started speaking other languages. It should be taught to others." The plot of this film follows the story of the Kusunda people - narrated by Sen-Kusunda - who were once a nomadic community and are currently settled in villages. Over the years almost all the Kusundas have left speaking their language. This documentary arguably contains the most detailed video interviews of Sen-Kusunda. Her younger sister Kamala Sen Khatri is the sole fluent speaker of the Kusunda language at the moment. Uday Raj Aley, who plays a key role in this film has researched about the Kusunda language over the years and has published a trilingual Kusunda-Nepali dictionary.},

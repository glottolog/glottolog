    abstract = {This study examines one type of directives—requests—and analyses the (socio-) pragmatic variation in two socio-cultural contexts—i.e. Persian and American—with regards to expectations of compliance and preferred request strategies when requesting in four different social situations. The main focus of the study is on perceptive data elicited from both interlocutors (i.e. the requestor and the requestee) when they use such strategies. Role-play interactions, stimulated recall procedure and questionnaires based on the interactions were used to collect the required data from 45 American and 55 Iranian native speakers. As for indirectness, a cross-cultural comparison revealed that conventionally indirect requests are the preferred strategy in these two cultures. Also, the results of the questionnaires showed that more indirect strategies resulted in more certainty of compliance in both cultures. However, the perception of social power and social distance variables differed in these cultures. Whereas, the Americans were more influenced by the social distance between the interlocutors, the Iranians were more concerned with the social power of the requestee than the Americans.},

    abstract = {The range of structures commonly classed as close appositives forms a rich ecological niche where each construction relates to the other constructions forming a dense network of taxonomic and inheritance ties (Goldberg 1995). As a first approximation to the concept of close apposition, however, the structure of that network falls outside the scope of this article, where I focus on the theoretical notion of close apposition itself, on how it deviates from that of loose apposition (Acuña-Fariña 2006), and on an analysis of a quintessentially close appositive construction, the the poet Burns type in the literature (Curme 1947; Lee 1952; Fries 1952; Haugen 1953; Hockett 1955, 1958). The thesis that these strings are formed by a doubly endocentric structure where the putative first segment (the poet) is a grounded nominal (i.e. an active referent; e.g. Langacker 1991; Taylor 2002) is rejected. Instead, it is argued that these highly conventionalized close appositions are instances of `inchoate' noun phrase structure, and that the internal constituency of such strings is not fully elaborated due to a lack of strong functional pressure. Three reasons are put forward in order to defend such a view: 1. the construction has as its job the activation of a social referent, and in the social world that we inhabit this is usually done either by name or profession, with no logical incompatibility between the two; 2. the construction is a hybrid of distinct and more productive (and fully elaborated) templates, which act as attractor poles and pull constituency in opposite directions; and 3. the construction is easily identifiable as such `from the top'. This makes it unnecessary to have to spend valuable cognitive resources (like creating, storing and deploying inaudible, abstract, constituent structure) when, somewhat metaphorically, one can reach the final destination of that journey (the last stop being meaning) directly, as it were, with no changing of trains (Haiman 1994; Boyland 1996; Hay 2001). The present analysis is framed along lines compatible with various forms of Construction Grammar.},

Speakers of East Tucanoan languages and of one Arawak language, Tariana, participate in the exogamous marriage network and share the obligatory multilingualism. Long-term interaction between East Tucanoan languages and Tariana has resulted in the rampant diffusion of grammatical and semantic patterns and calquing of categories. A typologically unusual system of 11 imperatives in Tariana bears a strong impact from East Tucanoan languages; but to say that imperative meanings were just borrowed or calqued from East Tucanoan languages would be a simplification. The markers come from different non-imperative categories, via distinct mechanisms.

Our knowledge of what the particular speaker is likely to know is our only guide here. We will make different assumptions for the speaker who is a four-year-old child, George W. Bush, or a native of Barcelona (and so on). The same goes for the addressee: an adult addressing a four-year-old child will very likely follow up by identifying the architect. We only know whether speaker and hearer correctly identify the architect from the co-text, and this requires considerably more inferencing from contextual and encyclopaedic data than Jaszczolt allows. This paper criticizes some of the assumptions of Default Semantics and suggests some emendations to the theory, including additional machinery showing a mapping from the words uttered to the intended meaning in the case of `the best architect designed this church'.},

Some authors have even questioned the existence of qi iambs (e.g., Hayes 1995). The consequence of the existence of qi iambs is that foot headedness and quantity sensitivity are independent: whether a foot is trochaic or iambic is unrelated to whether it is also quantity-sensitive. The lack of a solid case for quantity-insensitive iambs motivates a close investigation of Osage, which has many characteristics that are directly relevant; it is the first quantity-insensitive iambic system that has been subject to relevant phonetic examination.},

A path of grammaticalization is described as starting from the Proto-Germanic derivational prefix *ga- and leading to inflectional ge- in Old English. Quantitative evidence is gathered in favour of a progressive loss of the derivational productivity of the prefix that is paralleled by a gradual increase in inflectional distribution. The conclusion is reached that the neuter noun which is zero derived from the strong verb contributes through its derivatives to the decategorialization of the prefix ge-, which undergoes grammaticalization for reasons of over-markedness, becomes exclusively inflectional and, ultimately, disappears.},

Recent approaches no longer consider blends unpredictable, but the role of stress in blend formation has not been investigated in detail yet. This article addresses this problem, focusing on the role of stress in determining the switchpoint of the two bases in the blend, and on the question of what determines the stress pattern of the blend. We investigate these questions using experimentally derived forms, coined by native speakers on the basis of carefully controlled word pairs as stimuli. The results demonstrate that the length of the blend, the location of the switchpoint, and the stress of the blend are crucially determined by stress properties of the two base words of the blend, above all by those of the second word. At a theoretical level, the most important single finding is that preservation of the stress of the second word may happen independently of preservation of segmental material of the stressed syllable (e.g. préstitant from prestı́gious + dóminant). In contrast to stress, and contrary to earlier claims, syllabic constituency is shown to be of minor importance for switchpoint location. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. On a methodological level, our results show that experimentally elicited blends constitute a valid and highly useful resource for research on blend structure.},

Conversely, one area that receives relatively little attention from typologists is morphology. This too is hardly surprising: of all the aspects of language, morphology is the most language-specific and hence least generalizable. Indeed, even the very presence of a meaningful morphological component is language-specific.},

Standard software is used to express the relationships between languages graphically. The current article compares the results of our lexicon-based approach with the results of a similar exercise that takes the typological variables contained in the WALS database as a point of departure. We establish that the latter approach leads to even better results than the lexicon-based one. The best result in terms of correspondence with some well-established genetic and areal classifications, however, is attained when the lexical and typological methods are combined, especially if we select both the most stable Swadesh items and the most stable WALS variables.},

The speech of 90 of the informants is analysed acoustically; it is supplemented with minimal-pair tests and word list reading. F1/F2 measurements and minimal-pair test results are subjected to a series of multiple linear regression analyses, with social class, gender, age and style as independent variables. While the low-back merger is a change from below showing a female lead and a curvilinear effect of social class, the pin–pen merger shows a decreasing monotonic relationship with social class and no female advantage. The difference is argued to be due to the two mergers being at different levels of social awareness.},

This paper proposes a taxonomy of these suffixes based on two parameters—the distinction between a causative, which adds a subject, and an applicative, which adds an object, and the distinction between direct and nondirect—that is, whether the causee or the applied object is a direct object or is more oblique. This study also touches on some current debates in Salishan studies about whether these morphemes are inflectional or derivational, and the extent to which verbal radicals can be treated as uniformly unaccusative, a characterization of the family that has been used to motivate some significant claims about language universals.},

While they have been a regular feature of English for centuries, and are a common phenomenon in present-day English, too, they have often been overlooked in the literature on the grounds that they are a marginal, playful feature of the English language, which do not merit a systematic and proper analysis in their own right. However, there is much more to rhyming compounds than meets the eye. The paper challenges the marginality of rhyming compounds in general, and demonstrates that the meaning of such compounds is inextricably linked to the rhyming quality, i.e. the form. By an in-depth analysis of the five major semantic categories that lexicalized rhyming compounds denote, the paper comes to the conclusion that rhyme can be associated with four primary functions: imitation; intensification; diminution; and unconventionality. It is argued that these four functions lie at the heart of the semantic motivation of English rhyming compounds, thereby illustrating yet another facet of the non-arbitrariness of language.},

Scholars have cited syntactic intransitivity, semantics, or some combination thereof as motivation for when iteratives are marked as middles. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of iteratives from traditional Dena'ina (Athabaskan, Alaska) narratives. This analysis strongly suggests that while grammatical transitivity plays a role in the triggering of overt morphological marking of middles, verb meaning plays an even more important overall role, and thus supports the assumption of a semantically unified class of middle verbs. More specifically, we show that in Dena'ina iterative verbs, middle marking is more likely to occur when the spatial starting and ending points of the action of the verb are undifferentiated.},

While NPs with recursive relative clauses occupy the syntactic end, nominal compounds are located at the lexical end. In between these extremes we find NPs with recursive periphrastic genitives (towards the syntactic end) and NPs with recursive Saxon genitives (towards the lexical end). This study presents a comparative analysis of the branching direction preferences in these recursive structures. The empirical focus is on double of-genitives, which exhibit an overwhelming predilection for right-branching. This contrasts sharply with the double Saxon genitives, which gravitate towards left-branching. The branching direction decision is argued to be under the sway of several distinct factors: a syntactic factor controlling the alternative between leftward and rightward expansion; a lexical factor regulating the idiomatization of a given pair of elements; and a processing factor geared towards preventing garden path effects. Furthermore, branching direction is determined by listeners' desire to minimize constituent recognition domains. Taken together, these factors are held accountable for the varying branching direction biases found in the different types of NP.},

The latter can be elegantly captured in a Construction Grammar framework since constructions by definition can include pragmatic features. Also, this article claims that constructions may be equipped with an additional `context slot', in which co- and contextual information can be stored. In a final section, this article turns to the issue of tense as a grammatical phenomenon and its genesis in grammaticalisation processes. It is suggested that a Construction Grammar account can make the age-old debate about a future tense in English redundant. Instead, it complements studies in grammaticalisation and opens up some interesting perspectives on parallel developments in the onto- and phylogenesis of constructions.},

Exploring the light verb construction take prisoner, we see that one and the same construction involves both lexicalisation and grammaticalisation processes. For grammaticalisation, the focus will be on the semantic bleaching of take and the productivity of the pattern take + NP. For the lexicalisation of the construction, we will focus on the increasing fixedness of the collocation take prisoner, evident from the decreasing acceptability of the pattern make prisoner, and on the decategorialisation of the original NP prisoner, which is manifested in the loss of plural -s inflection in prisoner. The article further investigates the decategorialisation of prisoner, revealing that the word order of prisoner(s) relative to its complement NP (e.g. take the men prisoner(s) vs take prisoner(s) the men) has a considerable effect on the speed of plural s-deletion.},

We argue here that it is also possible for grammatical innovation to emerge out of the communicative demands of written discourse. In particular, the distinctive communicative characteristics of academic writing (informational prose) have led to the development of a discourse style that relies heavily on nominal structures, with extensive phrasal modification and a relative absence of verbs. By tracking the historical development of this discourse style, we can also observe the development of particular grammatical functions that are emerging in writing. We focus here on two grammatical features – nouns as nominal premodifiers and prepositional phrases as nominal postmodifiers – analyzing their historical development over the last four centuries in a corpus of academic research writing (compared to other registers such as fiction, newspaper reportage and conversation). Our analysis shows that these grammatical features were quite restricted in function and variability in earlier historical periods of English. However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, they became much more frequent and productive, accompanied by major extensions in their functions, variants, and range of lexical associations. These extensions were restricted primarily to informational written discourse, illustrating ways in which new grammatical functions emerge in writing rather than speech.},

Typology as a discipline In the past century, typology was mostly used as an alternative method of pursuing one of the same goals as generative grammar: to determine the limits of possible human languages and, thereby, to contribute to a universal theory of grammar. The paradigm result was the absolute universal law that would rule out as linguistically impossible what would seem logically imaginable, e.g., a language with a gender distinction exclusively in the 1st person singular.},

This study contributes to the ongoing re-assessment of Australian vowel characteristics by examining formant data of the /hVd/ vowels of 13 female and nine male adolescents from Melbourne, in relation to recent data from Sydney and Adelaide and earlier data from New South Wales. Results yield evidence of regional vowel differences, with signs that these interact with vowel innovation, and that the presence of regional and innovative vowel characteristics differs for males and females.},

This paper offers the first detailed study of the phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties of prefixation in Kashibo-Kakataibo. In contrast to other authors' analyses of Panoan prefixes, we present evidence to show that prefixes in Kashibo-Kakataibo are synchronically independent morphemes, rather than allomorphs of body-part nouns. Subsequently, we present the diachronic scenarios that can account for the perplexing formal and semantic similarities between body-part prefixes and body-part nouns in Kashibo-Kakataibo},

This paper considers phonetic variability in laryngealized resonants, which are rare cross-linguistically but common in the Pacific Northwest languages (Salish and Wakashan). Previous literature on these sounds has focused primarily on variability in timing between the oral and laryngeal gestures. This paper explores instead variability in the realization of the laryngeal gesture, focusing on St'át'imcets (Lillooet Salish). Pitch, amplitude, and duration measurements are taken to characterize the laryngeal gesture of intervocalic laryngealized resonants. Results exhibit a high degree of variability but show that, overall, realization depends primarily on the location of the laryngealized resonant with respect to word stress: the correlates of laryngealization are acoustically stronger in post-stress than in pre-stress position. Results are discussed in terms of their possible causes and in terms of their implications for how sound structure is lexically encoded.},

Regular referring practices reveal cultural preferences for choosing particular classes of reference forms for engaging in particular types of activities. When speakers of the northern Australian language Murriny Patha refer to each other, they display a clear preference for associating the referent to the current conversation's participants. This preference for Association is normally achieved through the use of triangular reference forms such as kinterms. Triangulations are reference forms that link the person being spoken about to another specified person (e.g. Bill's doctor). Triangulations are frequently used to associate the referent to the current speaker (e.g. my father), to an addressed recipient (your uncle) or co-present other (this bloke's cousin). Murriny Patha speakers regularly associate key persons to themselves when making authoritative claims about items of business and important events. They frequently draw on kinship links when attempting to bolster their epistemic position. When speakers demonstrate their relatedness to the event's protagonists, they ground their contribution to the discussion as being informed by appropriate genealogical connections (effectively, `I happen to know something about that. He was after all my own uncle').},

We pursue the idea that these may in fact be instances of Noun Incorporation (NI) in Washo. These two constructions differ in their morphosyntactic and discourse properties, specifically with respect to argument structure and discourse transparency of the nominal initial. We compare the properties of BPI and INI stems against the typological predictions made by two influential theories of NI: the lexicalist theory of Rosen (1989) and the syntactic theory of Baker (1988) and Baker, Aranovich, and Golluscio (2004). We ultimately conclude that BPI stems represent an example of syntactic NI, while INI stems do not involve NI at all but rather are more akin to instrumental affix constructions found in other Amerindian languages.

The game falls into the general category of `reversing games'. We propose that all reversing games are the result of the same process: a phonologically empty morpheme that is concatenated with the word and is then phonetically realized by movement out of linear order of some of the phonological material of the base word into the affix position. The target of movement as well as the landing site for the moved element is determined by different rankings of the game specific faithfulness constraints.},

They propose that the difference between BE and Standard English (SE) is that whereas expletive there is introduced in Spec vP in the latter it is introduced in Spec TP in the former. On the assumption that transitive subjects originate in Spec vP, this entails that expletive there cannot co-occur with a transitive verb. While it is clear that BE is different from SE in this area, it is not clear that BE has TECs while SE does not. There are a variety of examples which are acceptable in BE but not SE which do not seem to be TECs. SE also has certain examples which might be called TECs. The result of this is that Henry & Cottell's analysis is not very successful. It seems that what distinguishes BE from SE is not what verbs may follow the associate of the expletive but what elements may precede it. SE allows an associate immediately after be, but BE also allows an associate immediately after modals and have, and for some speakers seem and likely as well. The facts can be captured in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar by assuming that be has an extra lexical description with expletive there as its subject and the associate as an extra complement in both varieties of English, and that modals and have, and for some speakers seem and likely as well, have an extra lexical description of this form in BE. Generalizations can be captured if the pairs of lexical descriptions are analysed as alternative ways of fleshing out basic underspecified lexical descriptions.},

In this paper, I examine the morphology of the SR system found in the Traditional Hidatsa texts of Lowie (1939) and show that there were two different SR systems in Hidatsa that varied with registerial selection. I then detail how this SR system interacted with other clause-final markers within two distinct registers of speech. This older system is compared to that found in the set of Hidatsa texts published in 1978 by Parks, Jones, and Hollow. This comparative examination shows that in these more recent texts, the two distinct registers of speech are in the process of collapsing together. This is evident from the inconsistent use of the different SR systems. Data from recent fieldwork is then presented to show that in modern Hidatsa the different registers are only a relic of the older system and that the SR system has been reanalyzed as a less elaborate style of clause connectors. Possible explanations for how these two registers of speech originated are then proposed.},

    abstract = {In this article, it is proposed that processes of grammaticalization are determined and constrained not only by the source semantics of the grammaticalizing item, i.e. lexical persistence in the sense of Hopper (1991), but also by the original structure the item occurs in. This previously unrecognized feature of grammaticalization is referred to as structural persistence. The need to distinguish a structural equivalent to lexical persistence is argued on the basis of a particularly exemplary case, viz. the grammaticalization processes found with one lexically specific set of grammaticalizing elements in English, adjectives of difference such as other, different, various, etc. Before their grammaticalization, these adjectives occur in two different structural configurations, viz. (1) external comparison, in which the adjective describes a relation of difference between the referent of the noun phrase and a second, separately coded, entity, and (2) internal comparison, in which the entities that are said to be different are all denoted by the noun phrase containing the adjective. Even though they undergo the same general semantic process of grammaticalization and delexicalization in both structures, the adjectives acquire a different grammatical function in each of them. The different outcomes of the grammaticalization process can only be explained by relating them to the specific properties of the two source structures.},

    abstract = {It seems that Australian languages can borrow nouns more readily than verbs. If this is so, you would expect that if the speakers of a language divide into two groups which lose contact with one another, they will start borrowing from their new neighbours so that their percentages of common vocabulary will decrease. However, since they borrow nouns more readily, the percentage of nouns they have in common decreases faster than the percentage of verbs, so that the percentage of verbs remains always higher than the percentage of nouns. Conversely, since they are borrowing from their new neighbours, the vocabulary they have in common with them will increase, but it will increase faster for nouns than for verbs. Therefore, the percentage of common nouns will remain always higher than the percentage of common verbs. Using some well-established genetically related groups of languages and some of their well-established genetically unrelated or distantly related neighbours I will show that the figures conform to this hypothesis (notwithstanding that languages may really have much more complex histories than I am assuming). I then apply this method to some less clear-cut situations. The results in some cases point to a classification different from that generally accepted.},

    abstract = {Basing myself on synchronic and diachronic data analysis, I argue in this article that size nouns (SNs) such as bunch/load(s)/heap(s) of within binominal NPs display synchronic variation which can be hypothesized to be the result of grammaticalization processes. Synchronically, I propose that SNs have two major non-head uses, a quantifier use, e.g. a bunch of people walked in, and a valuing(-quantifying) use, in which the referent is evaluated rather than quantified. The latter is restricted mainly to bunch/load of, e.g. What a bunch of gobbledygook. The semantic and syntactic reanalysis of SNs as quantifiers has recently been acknowledged (e.g. Traugott forthcoming), but the valuing use of SNs remains largely unrecognized (see Brems 2007). On a theoretical level, it will be argued that head, quantifier and valuing(-quantifier) SN-uses synchronically have to be studied as collocationally constrained constructions in that the semantico-syntactic parsing of each SN-use links up with specific collocational patterns (Sinclair 1991). Head uses are restricted to sets of (un)count concrete nouns, whereas quantifier uses team up with all sorts of (un)count concrete as well as abstract nouns. Valuing uses show restrictions to concrete animate and abstract nouns, which they typically evaluate negatively, and have negative semantic prosody patterns, in which the SNs themselves come to predict negative collocates (see Louw 1993; Stubbs 1995; Bublitz 1996). The grammaticalization of SNs will be hypothesized to involve not only processes of semantic generalization and collocational extension, but also collocational reclusterings characterized by particular semantic prosody constraints. The latter are not traditionally associated with processes of grammaticalization and hence offer new insights into the semantic changes that may accompany grammaticalization.},

On the basis of new phonological data from British English varieties we argue that the reduction of /t/ in to should be taken as evidence of to-contraction. We claim that to is a phonological clitic and to-contraction is simply the incorporation of the clitic to into the preceding prosodic word.},

During the course of the twentieth century t-glottalling became a feature of the variety and so this article explores the possibility that as the frequency of use of t-glottalling increased, this would quickly overshadow t-to-r usage. Paradoxically, frequency of use is also responsible for the t-to-r phenomenon manifested today. More specifically, t-to-r remains in a small group of frequent words which are related by phonological shape. As a consequence of their frequency and shape, they have lexical strength and this is why a t-to-r fossil is maintained in WY today.},

We analyse our data according to a selection of parameters (ordering, verb type, duration, tense and aspect, subject identity, simultaneity type) and show that, against a background of relative stability, the major change is a dramatic increase in the frequency of simultaneity as-clauses from the first half of the nineteenth century onwards. Adapting the historical work on stylistic change by Biber and Finegan (1989, 1997), as well as theoretical and experimental accounts of the semantics of English simultaneity markers, we highlight an interesting parallelism between the spread of as-clauses in oral narrative from childhood to adulthood and the spread of as-clauses in modern fiction. In either case, the spread of as may be symptomatic of an evolution in narrative techniques, particularly in respect of the means by which complex events are typically represented.},

The article then shows that the diachronic data point to an expansion of the ARC from very specific instantiations, involving a limited set of verbs and adjectives/adverbs (i.e. the washing and cutting scenarios), to progressively more general types (which, however, set up a coherent network of analogical extensions). It is observed that this evolutionary path correlates with the metaphorical interpretation of actions as forces and the emergence of `proper' causative examples, i.e. examples where the verb only symbolises the causing subevent in the causal chain evoked by the RC. Further, it is argued that this investigation highlights the importance of the usage-based model in linguistic analysis.},

Individual landscape terms in various languages do not always have exact equivalents in other languages, or even in different varieties of the same language. One example is the term the bush in Australian English. The bush denotes an Australian landscape zone, but the word has developed additional senses related to culture and human geography. This study delineates the semantics of the bush in Australian English in relation to Australian culture. These meanings of the bush are described using the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) approach to linguistic analysis. The study finds that the bush is a keyword in Australian culture.

What is special about these distinctions is that they rely on a spatial asymmetry in relativizing a demonstrative referent (representing the Figure) to the deictic center (representing the Ground). A semantic typology of such demonstratives is constructed based on the nature of the asymmetries they employ. A major distinction is proposed between asymmetries outside the deictic Figure-Ground array (e.g., features of the larger environment) and those within it (e.g., facets of the speaker/addressee dyad). A unique system of the latter type, present in Jahai, an Aslian (Mon-Khmer) language spoken by groups of hunter-gatherers in the Malay Peninsula, is introduced and explored in detail using elicited data as well as natural conversational data captured on video. Although crosslinguistically unusual, spatial-coordinate demonstratives sit at the interface of issues central to current discourse in semantic-pragmatic theory: demonstrative function, deictic layout, and spatial frames of reference.},

Here we fill this gap and survey the known cases of object noun incorporation. The predicted order proves to be strongly preferred crosslinguistically and warrants recognition as a strong statistical universal. However, it is strongest in unproductive and fossilized contexts, the opposite of what is expected if the position of the incorporated noun is determined solely by principles of syntactic movement. The universal must therefore be nonsyntactic, perhaps morphological, in nature and appears to involve a preferred position for heads and/or for noun and verb roots within words.

This paper demonstrates not only that the first group is valid but also that it forms a higher level subgroup with Tataltepec. The comparison illustrates that even with a limited number of identifiable phonological innovations useful for subgrouping, a successful classification is achievable with supporting evidence from shared sporadic morphological and semantic innovations, and by taking advantage of comparative work in a sister sub-family (Zapotec) in order to filter out retentions.

Nivaclé and Chorote do not allow items of acculturation to impose foreign lexical material on these languages, but rather impose their own linguistic resources on newly acquired items. This paper considers the linguistic consequences of acculturation, of contact with Spanish cultural items not formerly known to the speakers of these languages. While the linguistic and anthropological literature contains numerous studies of hispanisms and linguistic acculturation, the Nivaclé and Chorote cases are different from the majority of these other studies, and this calls for closer investigation},

The selection depends on several interrelated factors including verbal semantics, valency, derivational morphology, and phonological factors, but it is partly lexically determined. Until now, aspect marking in Chatino has defied concise description (Rasch 2002 and Pride 2004) because previously documented varieties have undergone considerable phonological and morphological reduction, wiping out some of the earlier systematic patterns. ZEN, on the other hand, is conservative in these respects. In addition to describing the ZEN verb classes in synchronic terms, I demonstrate that they line up well with Kaufman's (1987) proposed verb classes for Zapotec and Proto-Zapotec. With slight modification, Kaufman's system applies to Proto-Zapotecan, the parent language of Zapotec and Chatino. The basic system has remained stable through time, despite elaborations and innovations in the individual languages. This study also documents in Chatino several derivational morphemes and a progressive aspect prefix reconstructed for Proto-Zapotec (Kaufman 1993), showing that they are of Proto-Zapotecan vintage.},

By offering an explicit theory for the construal of semantically simplex event descriptions from morphologically complex verbal stems, we flesh out intuitions dating back to Clark and Clark (1979) about the role of derivational morphology in the interpretation of derived verbs, especially denominal verbs. This latter point is of particular relevance to a general theory of verb meaning (inclusive of, but not limited to, Aktionsart/lexical aspect), as most formal theories of lexical semantics have been primarily developed for languages with a rich verbal lexicon. By contrast, Australian languages often have a much smaller verbal lexicon and rely more heavily on productive processes of verbalization. The challenge we intend to meet is to provide a formal analysis that matches the productive morphology of the language under investigation. We offer an implementation couched within the Type Composition Logic (TCL) of Asher (2011), which demonstrates how TCL can successfully capture the contextual interpretation of productively derived Panyjima verbs.},

Lenition processes of this kind are difficult to account for in various models of phonology, because they are conditioned by a two-sided context. This paper presents an analysis, couched in Optimality Theory, of one such lenition pattern in Gaalpu, a Yolngu variety. I show that the process can be succinctly analysed in terms of two constraints: a constraint on consonant strength across syllable boundaries, and a constraint against non-continuants in a sonorous context (following Kingston's [2008] recent work). I argue that this analysis is superior to existing accounts precisely because it is able to capture the role of both the preceding segment and following segment in conditioning lenition. I show in addition that the alternation in Wubuy, previously analysed as hardening, can also be analysed succinctly using the same hierarchy proposed for the lenition process in Gaalpu.},

    abstract = {The variable phenomenon in which /t/ can be realized as a tap or rhotic approximant in varieties of Northern British English (commonly referred to as t-to-r, Wells 1982: 370) has received some attention in English linguistics as debates have appeared over how best to model its phonology (e.g. Carr 1991; Docherty et al. 1997; Broadbent 2008). The occurrence of t-to-r seems to be constrained by the preceding and following phonological environment in a largely systematic way and so it is often accounted for within a rule-based model of grammar. Problematically, however, the rule does not apply blindly across the board to all words which fit the specified phonological pattern. Instead, t-to-r shows evidence of being lexically restricted, and this fact has recently encouraged a usage-based interpretation. Until now, there has been relatively little attempt to test the usage-based thesis directly with fully quantified data gleaned from naturally occurring conversation. This article investigates the extent to which certain usage-based predictions can account for variation attested in t-to-r in Liverpool English. Using oral history interviews with Liverpool English speakers born in the early 1900s, we examine the usage-based predictions first proposed by Broadbent (2008) that t-to-r is more likely in (a) high-frequency words and (b) high-frequency phrases. There is some support for the importance of lexical frequency as a motivating factor in the use of t-to-r, but our data do not fully support either of these claims wholesale. We suggest that t-to-r is not constrained simply by word frequency or phrase frequency alone, but by a combination of both. Finally, we explore the possibility of employing notions from Cognitive Grammar such as schema strength (e.g. Taylor 2002; Bybee 1995: 430) in our interpretation of these data.},

The results of the production experiments suggest that prosodic prominence is realized by stressed syllable duration, f0 slope, and pitch accent type. While the perception experiments provide evidence that Paraguayan Guaranı́ listeners attend to these properties in prosodic prominence perception, they also show that listeners are not at ceiling in identifying the prosodically most prominent expression from the acoustic signal alone. These results are consistent with recent findings about prosodic prominence perception in other languages and provide empirical support from an American indigenous language for the hypothesis that non-acoustic factors, such as word frequency and information status, also play a role in prominence perception.

This observation necessitates the rejection of the phonological cycle as the mechanism for handling relative prominence preservation – the phonological cycle predicts that relative prominence preservation should be consistently successful. In particular, it is proposed, following Bermúdez-Otero & McMahon (2006) and Bermúdez-Otero (in preparation), that the phonological cycle which applies internal to stratum one in models of Lexical Phonology should be rejected, and replaced by the mechanism of `fake cyclicity'.

Significant regional and stylistic variations were noted. Australian and New Zealand English emerge as the most innovative regional varieties in their use of the progressive, as determined by both sheer frequency and a wide range of other variables, followed by the Southeast Asian varieties, then the influential American and British varieties, with Kenyan and Indian English the least innovative. The progressive was found to be twice as frequent in speech as in writing, an asymmetry no doubt relevant to the attested rise of the progressive in Modern English. Meanwhile the role that the simple present progressive form and the futurate use are claimed to have had in the growth of the progressive is reflected in their particular affinity for spoken English.},

    abstract = {All Mayan languages exhibit ergative–absolutive systems of agreement. However, Chol and some other members of the family display aspectually based splits: while perfective clauses show the expected ergative–absolutive alignment, imperfective and progressive (hereafter “nonperfective”) clauses show a nominative–accusative alignment (Larsen and Norman 1979, Bricker 1981, and Quizar and Knowles-Berry 1988). In addition to this difference in agreement, there are also important differences in stem morphology between perfective and nonperfective stems. I argue in this paper that nonperfective forms in Chol are formally possessed nominals. The main syntactic predicate is in fact the aspect marker, which shows absolutive agreement with its sole argument, the nominalized clause. Under this analysis, all predicates in Chol show an ergative–absolutive pattern of agreement. The illusion of split ergativity results from the nominalization of the notional predicate, along with the fact that ergative and genitive morphemes are identical in Mayan languages. This proposal builds on the suggestion in Larsen and Norman (1979) that the majority of splits in the Mayan family may be reduced to subordination.},

Since English and Wardaman are structurally very different languages, any common patterns in the mapping of grammatical units to intonation units would be of considerable interest as potential grammar-discourse universals. The Full GU Condition—IUs are almost always full GUs—holds in Wardaman as well as English and other languages. Both English and Wardaman employ a substantial number of grammatically independent noun phrase intonation units. Three factors constrain the occurrence of GUs in a single IU in English, in descending order of strength: parallelism, complexity and distance. All three factors also hold in Wardaman in the same order of strength. The behaviour of the IU–GU mapping in Wardaman supports critiques of the analyses of arguments as adjuncts and of modifiers as appositive phrases.

It marked the inauguration of Linguistic Typology, the occasion of this decennial retrospective. 1997 also witnessed the publication of the first volume of the EUROTYP series by Mouton de Gruyter (Siewierska (ed.) 1997). These volumes represent the culmination of the European Typology Project, which in addition to producing the research contained in the EUROTYP volumes, brought European typologists together on a regular basis, and created the sense of community that, among other things, led to the establishment of the Association for Linguistic Typology. 1997 also witnessed the publication of the first two volumes of the Oxford Studies in Typology and Linguistic Theory monograph series. Haspelmath's Indefinite Pronouns (Haspelmath 1997), the first volume, represents one of the best classical typological studies and brought wider attention to the semantic map model, of which more below. Stassen's Intransitive Predication (Stassen 1997) is awesome in scope and accomplishment, representing the largest crosslinguistic survey outside of phonology and word order up to that time, and providing many profound insights into the syntax and semantics of predication. Finally, 1997 witnessed the founding of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, with a Department of Linguistics directed by Bernard Comrie and devoted to typological research, language documentation, and related activities. This institute has provided resources and a focus for important new research in typology, such as The World Atlas of Language Structures (Haspelmath et al.

The Minamina yawulyu performed by Warlpiri women from Yuendumu community, Central Australia, is one such song cycle that is described in this way. However, it does not display many instances of ritual or archaic words or phonological skewing that would clearly differentiate this language from everyday Warlpiri. Instead the Minamina yawulyu uses regular language in a connotative way such that it is unintelligible without knowledge of the symbolic associations intended. In this way ritually knowledgeable people who understand the connotations of this language are required to interpret these songs giving them a degree of control over how this knowledge is transmitted. In this paper I will present some examples of metaphor, metonymy and image-schemata along with accompanying exegesis provided by Warlpiri informants. In highlighting this symbolic way of using language I will show that Warlpiri song language uses familiar physical and social experiences in Warlpiri people's lives such as those around landscape, kin relations and physical appearances and movement, to connote emotive responses to country and associated ceremonies. This paper will demonstrate the role of song in passing on the complexity of religious knowledge and also the ways in which ritually knowledgeable people control its transmission.},

However, Givón (1990; 2001) has claimed that in Pichis Ashéninca, an Arawakan language from Peru, there is only one content interrogative, tsica, that covers all possible interrogative meanings. In this article, I argue against this analysis. Based on a corpus of questions in Pichis Ashéninca, extracted from texts, I argue that most content questions do indeed use the word tsica, but the interrogative meaning is further specified by the construction in which it is used. When the different interrogative constructions are properly distinguished, Pichis Ashéninca distinguishes almost all interrogative categories expected from a European perspective. Still, the structure of these interrogative constructions in Pichis Ashéninca is special from a typological viewpoint because of these characteristics: (1) there is no distinction between `who' and `what'; (2) all content interrogative constructions are transparently built on the basis of just one root; (3) this basic interrogative root in isolation has the meaning `where'; and (4) the noninterrogative parts of the interrogative constructions are verbs. Based on a worldwide investigation of content interrogatives, I argue that these four characteristics are rare. However, all these characteristics are relatively widespread in South America, making it less of a surprise that there is a language in this part of the world that combines all of these unusual characteristics.},

    abstract = {The world's linguistic diversity is large, probably much larger than many linguists would want to admit. Dealing with this diversity is a central objective for worldwide crosslinguistic investigations. This article argues that to deal with diversity it is extremely fruitful to work with probable structures instead of possible structures, with models instead of theories, and with levels of justification instead of right or wrong. This is illustrated with the order of demonstrative, numeral, adjective, and noun within a complex noun phrase. Different NP-internal orders have strongly differing frequencies among the world's languages. Various models to capture these frequencies are proposed and compared to each other, and it will be argued that very simple models are sufficient. For example, a highly adequate model only refers to the fact that noun and adjective tend to occur together, nouns and demonstratives prefer to occur at the phrase boundary, and noun-adjective order is slightly more frequent than adjective-noun order. The same approach will also be used to model sentence word order frequencies, including areal preferences as random effects. Using such probabilistic models allows for a new take on typological explanations. In and of itself, a probabilistic model is no explanation. However, a well-fitting model instantiates a reformulation of the original phenomenon to be explained into smaller, more tractable phenomena.},

While /H/ and /L/ tones are unambiguously needed in underlying representations, we argue that the third tone is not /M/ but must rather be underspecified as /Ø/. Perhaps the most interesting of the several arguments presented is that strings of /Ø/ tone-bearing units are invisible to a process which deletes the second /L/ of a /L-Ø*-L/ sequence. We propose that all /L/ tones are underlying floating and that /L/ rather than /H/ is the marked tone in this three-value system. The surface mid and low-falling pitches in outputs are shown to derive by a small number of realizational rules, which also are responsible for producing successively upstepped H tones. The PM tone system is unusually interesting both from a general tonological perspective as well as for its relation to Dürr's (1987) Proto-Mixtec tones which have the inverted values in PM.},

We present five case studies of the development of postdeterminer meanings, based on the analysis of diachronic and synchronic data. The adjectives studied are opposite, complete, old, regular and necessary, whose postdeterminer uses relate to the basic deictic systems of space, quantity, time and modality. Our analysis of the data shows that the mechanism of secondary deictification can be given a unified characterization as the semantic shift by which a general relation expressed by the adjective is given a subjective reference point in or relative to the speech event.},

An analysis is offered of how the system of gerund constructions is functionally organised, comparing discourse-functional behaviour, distribution, and internal syntax across the three gerund types. It is shown that verbal gerunds closely resemble bare nominal gerunds in terms of discourse-functional behaviour and distribution, but are syntactically more flexible. As a result, verbal gerunds could replace bare nominal gerunds, copying their function but adding syntactic flexibility. By contrast, definite nominal gerunds, being functionally distinct from the other two types, developed a number of specialised uses, which ensured their survival. These conclusions throw light on issues of functional motivation in the development of the English gerund. Historical change is seen to be grounded in synchronic functional organisation. At the same time, it is shown that the only existing explanation for the rise of verbal gerunds (attributing their success to their ability to combine with prepositions) can only be partly correct.},

    abstract = {While earlier descriptions of the English present participle have tended to be too general or too exclusively focused on its progressive meaning, this article aims to present an account of the meanings of the English present participle that captures their full richness. It starts from the observation that many (though not all) present participle clauses/phrases are paradigmatically related to adjectival phrases, as manifested in their distributional properties (e.g. a challenging year, those living alone). The article analyses the semantic effects that arise from the tension between the verbal semantics of the participial stem and the adjectival semantics of the syntactic slot. These effects involve accommodation of the verbal situation to the requirement that a situation is represented as time-stable and as simultaneous to some contextually given reference time. The progressive meaning is one such semantic effect, but participles may also assume iterative, habitual or gnomic readings. Some construction-specific semantic extensions of this adjectival template are identified and a tentative explanation is offered for them. Those constructions where the present participle has lost its semantic association with adjective phrases, such as the progressive construction and integrated participle clauses, are shown to display loosening or specialization of semantic constraints.},

This article presents a quantitative corpus study of 370 QTs from the International Corpus of English that were annotated for prosodic phrasing and intonational realization of the QT and the host. Factors tested were polarity, position in the sentence and the turn as well as verb type. Generally, prosodic phrasing and intonational realization were highly correlated: separate QTs were mostly realized with a falling contour, while integrated QTs were mostly rising. Results from regression models showed a strong effect of polarity: QTs with an opposite polarity were more often phrased separately compared to QTs with constant polarity, but the phrasing of opposite polarity QTs was further dependent on whether the QT was negative or positive (more separate phrasing in negative QTs). Furthermore, prosodic separation was more frequent at the end of syntactic phrases and clauses compared to phrase-medial QTs. At the end of a turn, speakers realized more rising contours compared to QTs within a speaker's turn. Verb type also had an effect on the phrasing of the tag. Taken together, our results confirm some of the claims previously held for QTs, while others are modified and new findings are added.},

Additional evidence of such nominality has been drawn from the fact that in many of those languages a determiner can indeed top the CP projection (D + CP), thus creating a DP. In standard Spanish, speakers may optionally add such a determiner under certain semantic circumstances. Spanish finite clauses in principle fall under such a syntactic account. However, despite their nominal distribution, a constraint remains which apparently challenges such generalization. Finite clauses introduced by the complementizer que (`that')---que-clauses---may not combine with a determiner in spite of meeting all expected requirements. This paper offers a revision of the nominality of the Spanish finite que-clause. Special attention is devoted to the role of the determiner, arguing for a differentiation between the general nominality of finite clauses and the optional creation of a DP (D + CP) in certain contexts in Spanish. Furthermore, the paper includes an analysis of the unexpected constraint in prepositional contexts in terms of strict adjacency, which makes it possible to account for the lack of the D layer while retaining the nominality of que-clauses in Spanish.},

In previous accounts, the defining criteria are not applied systematically; there is a tendency towards definition by exemplification (especially when it comes to meanings that are `not permission' and `not ability') and certain categories (permission, for instance) tend to be defined in a circular way. We will argue that there are three criteria which are necessary and sufficient to distinguish five subclasses of root possibility meaning. The three criteria are: (a) the scope of the modal meaning, (b) the source of the modality and (c) the notion of potential barrier; the five meanings are: (a) ability, (b) opportunity, (c) permission, (d) general situation possibility (GSP) and (e) situation permissibility. The article offers an in-depth analysis of the three defining criteria and the root possibility meanings that their systematic application gives rise to. This approach clearly brings out the similarities and the dissimilarities between the different subcategories of root possibility meaning in English, and in this way it results in a more explicit taxonomy.},

Discussions of the fortis–lenis contrast in related languages argue that it may instead be considered a geminate–singleton contrast. However, lenis obstruents are frequently realized with voicing and spirantization. These phenomena have led other researchers to argue against reanalyzing “fortis–lenis” contrasts as consonant length contrasts. In the first of two experiments, I show that the primary phonetic correlate of the fortis–lenis contrast in Itunyoso Trique is duration. Fortis obstruents are additionally realized with a glottal spreading gesture, which is absent in lenis obstruents. In the second experiment, I show that durational changes, due to speech rate, account for variable patterns of spirantization and partial voicing. Abstract features of articulatory effort are not necessary to account for the phonetic variation in lenis obstruents in Trique. This analysis argues in favor of considering the consonantal contrast in Trique as one based on consonant length and glottal features. The findings are discussed in relation to gestural models of speech production and to patterns within other Oto-Manguean languages.},

Furthermore, the phonotactic constraint that dictates against the right-aligned morphemes appearing as suffixes, NoCoda, is the same one that is famously responsible for the infixation of left-aligned morphemes in Austronesian languages, showing that not only is right-edge aligned infixation perhaps not quite as rare as has been thought, but that it is governed by the same phonotactic constraints that determine left-aligned infixation. A historical motivation for this unusual alignment change is discussed, with a cautionary note on the use of under-analysed data in typological work.},

At the same time, the much less discussed break between the northern and the southern Austronesian languages is established, mapping the contrast between the northern, “Philippinetype” Austronesian languages and their southern neighbours, despite the lack of any well-accepted genetic boundary between these two areas, implying substratal influence similar to that which characterises the eastern Austronesian languages.},

This suggests that any does not involve scales as part of its core meaning, but produces them as a derived interpretative property. The role of three factors in the derivation of the expressive effect of scalarity is explored: grammatical number, stress and the presence of gradable concepts in the NP. The general conclusions point to the importance of developing a causal semantic analysis in which the contributions of each of the various meaningful components of an utterance to the overall message expressed are carefully distinguished.},

    abstract = {This article attempts to repair the neglect of the qualitative uses of some and to suggest an explanation which could cover the full range of usage with this determiner – both quantitative and qualitative – showing how a single underlying meaning, modulated by contextual and pragmatic factors, can give rise to the wide variety of messages expressed by some in actual usage. Both the treatment of some as an existential quantifier and the scalar model which views some as evoking a less-than-expected quantity on a pragmatic scale are shown to be incapable of handling the qualitative uses of this determiner. An original analysis of some and the interaction of its meaning with the defining features of the qualitative uses is proposed, extending the discussion as well to the role of focus and the adverbial modifier quite. The crucial semantic feature of some for the explanation of its capacity to express qualitative readings is argued to be non-identification of a referent assumed to be particular. Under the appropriate conditions, this notion can give rise to qualitative denigration (implying it is not even worth the bother to identify the referent) or qualitative appreciation (implying the referent to be so outstanding that it defies identification). The explanation put forward is also shown to cover some's use as an approximator, thereby enhancing its plausibility even further.},

    abstract = {This article examines possible motivations for the choice of particle verb word order in Middle English (1100--1500) and Early Modern English (1500--1700). The word order alternation of Present-Day English particle verbs, which presents language users with a choice between verb–object–particle and verb–particle–object order, first emerged in Early Middle English (twelfth century). For Present-Day English, several studies (e.g. Gries 1999, 2003; Dehé 2002) have shown that the choice is influenced by a number of linguistic factors, such as the heaviness of the object (morphosyntactic factor) and the givenness of the object (discourse factor). This article reveals the influence of a number of morphosyntactic factors and also shows that the choice is increasingly influenced by the givenness of the object. The differences between Present-Day English on the one hand and Middle and Early Modern English on the other hand are discussed in the light of syntactic changes going on in these periods. It is argued that the developments in particle verb syntax are characterised by an increasing division of labour between the two word orders, which may also explain why both orders survive into Present-Day English.},

Laryngeal segments in Capanahua show a number of positional effects. They can only surface within morpheme-initial syllables. This study shows that within that position, the distinction between head and nonhead syllables plays a major role in governing the alternations shown by glottal stops. Coda glottal stops can only surface in head-syllables since they inhibit glottal coalescence, a process triggered elsewhere. In contrast, in nonhead syllables, glottal stops fuse with the preceding vowel, resulting in glottalized vowels. The underlying representations of morphemes can only contain one glottal feature; that is, either [constricted glottis] or [spread glottis] but not both. However, in Capanahua, this restriction does not hold at the level of phonetic representation since glottal stops and glottal fricatives co-occur when the glottal fricative is the debuccalized output correspondent of an underlying sibilant. Extensive sets of data accompanied by spectrograms showing the laryngeal segments discussed are provided. Similar patterns found in Huariapano and Cayuga are discussed.},

CCG obeys a tight, compositional relation between syntax and semantics, while providing a flexible notion of surface structure that we exploit for Haida word order. We show that a small inventory of lexical categories in combination with CCG's rules supports the discontinuities we discuss, while also accounting for a bracketing paradox that would require considerably more effort in a phrase-structural approach. Our analysis reveals Haida's discontinuities as a spectrum of increasing opacity—simple, adverbial, and anaphoric—with respect to the relation between form and meaning.},

Most notably, the Hup Jussive (thirdperson imperative/optative) has arguably arisen from an applicative, a typologically unusual source for a construction of this kind. In its turn, the Hup Jussive has produced an epistemic modal. These developments hinge on the remarkably polyfunctional etymon ?ūh, which has two further, apparently related functions in the language, as a nominal kin term and an Interactional (reciprocal) prefix. While the Hup case appears to be the first documented example of an applicative source for a modal, a broader typological perspective suggests that valence-changing operations are in fact a relatively natural step in the grammaticalization of obligation modals, which often involves the introduction and subsequent backgrounding of a participant. The Hup case contributes to our understanding of the diachronic origins of modals and of the functional links between modality and other grammatical systems.},

We develop a typology of valency/transitivity mismatches in reciprocal constructions, based on a sample of Australian languages. These include: (i) monovalent clauses with a single ergative NP, (ii) mismatches between case marking and the apparent number of arguments, (iii) ergative marking on secondary predicates and instrumentals with an intransitive subject, and (iv) complex clause constructions sensitive to valency. Such mismatches, we argue, result from an “overlay problem”: both divalent and monovalent predicates in the semantic representation of prototypical reciprocal scenes have had a hand in shaping the morphosyntax of reciprocal constructions.},

It is also shown that there is a correlation between the part of the construction that is affected, and the type of motivation.

This paper attempts to bring clarification to the situation, presenting new research findings from an ongoing study of Kumeyaay dialects south of the border, integrating them with the previous literature, and drawing on current linguistic anthropological theory concerning dialect variation and language ideology. It argues that the two indigenous subgroupings of `Iipay and Tiipay are distinct both linguistically and historically in terms of social organization to some extent. Hill's (2001) anthropological model for dialectology, which includes attention to the relation between human ecology, social organization, and two basic types of stance—“localist” vs. “distributed”—as well as Kroskrity's notion of variationist language ideology, are employed to explain the exuberant lexical variation found between these two dialectal subgroups of the California Yuman language family.},

    abstract = {Recent areal and typological research has brought to light several syntactic features which English shares with the Celtic languages as well as some of its neighbouring western European languages, but not with (all of) its Germanic sister languages, especially German. This study focuses on one of them, viz. the so-called it-cleft construction. What makes the it-cleft construction particularly interesting from an areal and typological point of view is the fact that, although it does not belong to the defining features of so-called Standard Average European (SAE), it has a strong presence in French, which is in the `nucleus' of languages forming SAE alongside Dutch, German, and (northern dialects of) Italian. In German, however, clefting has remained a marginal option, not to mention most of the eastern European languages which hardly make use of clefting at all. This division in itself prompts the question of some kind of a historical-linguistic connection between the Celtic languages (both Insular and Continental), English, and French (or, more widely, Romance languages). Before tackling that question, one has to establish whether it-clefting is part of Old (and Middle) English grammar, and if so, to what extent it is used in these periods. In the first part of this article (sections 2 and 3), I trace the emergence of it-clefts on the basis of data from The York–Toronto–Helsinki Corpus of Old English Prose and The Penn–Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English, second edition. Having established the gradually increasing use of it-clefts from OE to ME, I move on to discuss the areal distribution of clefting among European languages and its typological implications (section 4). This paves the way for a discussion of the possible role played by language contacts, and especially those with the Celtic languages, in the emergence of it-clefting in English (section 5). It is argued that contacts with the Celtic languages provide the most plausible explanation for the development of this feature of English. This conclusion is supported by the chronological precedence of the cleft construction in the Celtic languages, its prominence in modern-period `Celtic Englishes', and close parallels between English and the Celtic languages with respect to several other syntactic features.},

These fourth-person pronouns are typologically exceptional in that they do not also code possession or intraclausal coreference, do not play a role in indirect speech, and coreference is not restricted to matrix subjects. The interaction of argument structure and intra- and interclausal morphosyntax creates a complex but systematic set of rules governing the fourth person as opposed to the simple third person. The functions of the fourth person in Matses are explored in depth, particularly with respect to how they have motivated and shaped the evident diachronic development of the fourth-person forms from simple third-person pronouns that have been replaced by zero-anaphora.},

An additional ergative system exists for this language in a special set of verbs, here called Group 1, where S is indexed on the verb in the same way as O.

What is yet to be established, however, is whether point of view still prevails in references to animals when the antecedent noun specifies the sex of the referent (e.g. stallion, ewe). In that case the neuter is known to occur but there is no quantitative assessment of the phenomenon, although it is crucial to understanding the influence of sex on gender selection. This article therefore proposes a statistical analysis of gender use in personal pronouns focusing exclusively on cases in which the antecedent noun specifies the sex of the animal. The analysis is carried out at the scale of the multi-million-word Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA), using Pearson's chi-square test complemented by the odds ratio estimate. Three questions are considered: how common is the neuter? Is its relative frequency the same with female animals as with males? Finally, do the proportions vary according to the position of the anaphor relative to its antecedent?},

This would contrast with findings reported in recent cross-linguistic work on such sequences.

Sixteen received no response in the proximally subsequent talk. Whilst most of these questions were answered, the offset time between question and response was long compared to previous studies. There was also a higher rate of non-answers and non-responses. For some cases of non-responses, contingent factors easily explained the lack, but in a few the reasons were not so apparent. It is argued that a significant factor in the relatively long silence between question and answer, and the relatively high rate of non-answers or non-responses, is that the parties in the talk spend much of the time in `continuing states of incipient talk', rather than in tightly focused and temporally bound conversation, which may help to account for the apparent relaxation of gap minimization and response mobilization.},

    abstract = {Constructions involving a ditransitive verb, a direct theme object, and an indirect recipient object have been extensively studied – especially in the contexts of the `dative' and the `benefactive alternations', i.e. the alternations between a double-object construction (DOC) (e.g. She gave him a book) and a corresponding prepositional construction (PREP) either with to (e.g. She gave a book to him) or with for (e.g. She bought a book for him). The present study focuses on a ditransitive phenomenon which occurs in British dialects: when both objects are pronouns, three variants of encoding are possible: DOC (e.g. Give me it!), PREP (e.g. Give it to me!) and the alternative double-object construction (altDOC) (e.g. Give it me!). The regional distribution and diachronic development of the three constructions are traced using two corpora containing regional speech: the Freiburg English Dialect Corpus (FRED)1 and the online version of the British National Corpus (BNCweb). In concentrating on a dialect phenomenon, in taking language-external determinants of the `dative/benefactive alternation' into consideration, and in investigating these empirically, the present study takes a novel approach to the much-discussed topic of ditransitives in English.},

    abstract = {This article is concerned with the sources, paths and mechanisms of change leading to noun-intensifying uses of adjectives, such as a complete mess, a whole bunch of crazy stuff, a particular threat. Such intensifying uses may develop from property-describing uses of adjectives, as discussed by Traugott (1989), Adamson (2000) and Paradis (2000, 2001, 2008). As pointed out by Bolinger (1972: 61), noun-intensifying uses may also develop from elements of the NP that have identifying functions, which can be either quantifying-identifying or identifying in the strict sense. The aim of this article is to provide a new synthesis of how these three pathways lead towards noun-intensifying meanings, focusing on the question of how the intensification scales necessary to these uses are acquired. We posit that the concepts of open and closed intensification scales (Kennedy & McNally 2005) can generalize over the intensifying uses from the three sources. The main mechanism of change is the foregrounding of the gradability mode (Paradis 2000), quantification scale or other implied scale of the immediate source uses. The initial shift takes place in collocational environments that overlap with those of the source uses. Due to later collocational extension, noun-intensifying uses may come to incorporate intensification scales unpredicted by their sources.},

I demonstrate moreover that such an analysis explains various aspects of morphological and phonological behaviour on the part of adverbial -ly which differ from the behaviour of adjectival -ly and/or from the behaviour of derivational suffixes. And I argue that contrary to a recent claim, the syntactic behaviour of adverbs presents no obstacle to the single-category analysis of adjectives and adverbs warranted by the morphology.},

There are six types of head-marked objects in Yurakaré, each with its own morphosyntactic and semantic properties. Distributional patterns suggest that the six objects can be divided into two larger groups reminiscent of the typologically recognized direct vs. indirect object distinction. This paper looks at the interaction of this complex system of participant marking and verbal semantics. By investigating the participant-marking patterns of nine verb classes (four representing a gradual decrease of patienthood of the P participant, five a gradual decrease of agentivity of the A participant), I come to the conclusion that grammatical roles in Yurakaré can be defined semantically, and case frames are to a high degree determined by verbal semantics.},

The second and larger class, “active” intransitives, consists of animate verbs that take arguments with differing degrees of control and agentivity.

The latter claim, however, appears to clash with previous observations (cf. Bolinger 1972) on the growing scope of the adverb in Present-day English. Through a corpus-based diachronic study (1500--present day), the present article unearths a number of environments where very much does not seem to fit neatly within the functional classifications that it has been assigned to in recent literature and standard grammars of English. It suggests that, from the Late Modern English period onwards (1800--), very much seems to have been developing sentence modifier functions, hence moving along Traugott's (1995) Internal Adverb > Sentence Adverb > Discourse Particle cline.},

Vowel duration is correlated with constituent size such that vowels in final position of larger domains are longer than vowels in final position of smaller domains. The correlation between domain size and duration is observed for both phonemic short and long vowels, thereby ensuring that the contrast in length is preserved in all contexts. Final vowel duration is further shown to be blind to metrical structure: all final vowels undergo lengthening regardless of whether or not they occur in strong position of a disyllabic iambic foot. Final lengthening thus preserves the canonical iambic foot template in which stressed syllables are heavy. Word-medial lengthening and word-final lengthening are, however, different in nature. Unlike medial vowels, final vowels characteristically end in a breathy phase, where the duration of breathiness is correlated with domain size.},

The left peripheral elements in the Niuean noun phrase are detailed, and it is argued that case in conjunction with a feature for proper/common serves the first function, that definiteness and specificity are not encoded in Niuean except in a secondary manner, and that referentiality is provided by number, which is distributed across several items in the noun phrase. It is demonstrated that while definiteness and specificity are not contrastive features in Niuean, a feature encoding focused and new information is central to the Niuean nominal system. Niuean thus supports a view of determiners that allows them to vary in their semantic and featural content.},

    abstract = {Speech pathologists are typically described as communication specialists whose prime focus is to work with people who have communication disorders. Speech pathology is often described as a communication science. The key to understanding how speech pathologists conceptualize communication lies in understanding how speech pathologists as a profession deal with the notion of what constitutes effective communication. Typically speech pathologists identify communication as effective when both the speaker and the listener have executed their roles to an age expected level within the biological capabilities of the individual. The way speech pathologists talk about communication identifies their conceptualization of communication as primarily a biological process. Speech pathologists also use the language of descriptive linguistics to describe the specific aspects of an individual's communication system but this use of linguistic terminology occurs in such a way that it too becomes another means of defining communication in terms of biology. This definition fits neatly within the realm of the health sciences which is where speech pathology is typically situated as speech pathology tends to follow a medical model in relation to the identification and treatment of communication disorders. Duchan describes the medical view of diagnosis as, `locating the problem within the individual, preferably within the person's biological system'. Given that communication is not only a biological phenomenon, this somewhat narrow conceptualization of communication can be problematic when applied to the many and varied situations in which speech pathologists are required to describe an individual's communication system.},

However, when they appear medially both actually and really are usually classified as intensifiers, and it has been argued that they are often interchangeable (see for example Lenk 1998; Oh 2000; Taglicht 2001). The purpose of this article is to test current thinking on this question by casting further light on the way medial actually and really are used in spoken discourse. Two complementary approaches are taken. Firstly, the interchangeability hypothesis is assessed on the basis of quantitative analyses of data from the British National Corpus. Secondly, the question of the extent to which actually and/or really function as intensifiers in preverbal position is addressed via a detailed qualitative analysis of data from a small corpus of recent BBC radio broadcasts of the panel-based political discussion programme Any Questions. The analyses presented here suggest that the interchangeability hypothesis is untenable and that the two adverbs have different core meanings, with any intensifying function being largely the result of interplay between the distinct semantic properties of each adverb and the discourse context.},

The metonymic shift that allows the integration of the prefix with the base can take place directly in cases in which both elements share the same domain. When two different domains are involved, the previous operation of a metaphor that neutralizes ontological differences between domains is required. To examine the metonymic and metaphoric operations, I take two Polish prepositions (na `on' and do `to') that have become prefixes and have changed the meaning of two specific verbs to which they have been attached, pakować `put things into a container' and myśleć `think', respectively. The first verb belongs to the domain of physical space, while the second does not. The analysis is conducted within the framework of Cognitive Grammar, which takes the view that all grammatical elements in language are meaningful and that they impose and symbolize particular ways of construing conceptual content. This paper shows that this is particularly evident in processes of grammaticalization of prepositions into prefixes.},

After providing some information on the sociolinguistic settings and the history of linguistic research in this area, we focus on the domain of argument-encoding systems in those languages and show how very diverse types of systems are found in languages spoken in very close proximity, including hierarchical/inverse cross-referencing systems, ergative systems, and split-intransitive systems. We also point to a number of typologically and theoretically interesting phenomena found in these languages, such as fluid transitivity, double-object ditransitive constructions, and rare valency-changing derivations such as multiple applicatives and sociative causatives.},

Depending on the language and the transitivity of the verb stem it attaches to, this suffix is used either to refer to a third-person plural S argument or a third-person singular or plural A argument, or to mark a passive derivation. In this paper, I argue that the suffixes are all historically related and that they come from a single source: a third-person plural suffix *-ta. I also suggest that this marker could have originated in a third-person plural independent pronoun that I reconstruct as **tuna.},

It illustrates the fact that descriptive adjectives can be used without nominal heads in English. Whereas in spoken language adjectives denoting more inherent properties feature prominently when the referents are present in the text-external world, no particular types of adjectives appear in written language. In terms of the latter, two major types of linguistic contexts are identified which do not require the use of a nominal head. It is argued that a conception of `contrast' as a `non-identity' condition cannot account for the variation between one-replacement and noun ellipsis since it holds for both phenomena. Similarly, partitivity is argued not to be a relevant requirement for the use of adjectives without nouns.},

Second, it eases the comparison between related non-human being concepts from different languages.

In such cases, the merging vowels appear to move past the point of coalescence in at least one phonetic dimension; difference is maintained but the vowel quality is opposite to the historical pattern on one or both dimensions. Flip-flop between the cot and caught vowels occurs for two speakers in a recent sample from San Francisco, California. The community shows robust change in progress toward a lower and fronter caught vowel nucleus, and no change in apparent time for cot. Further analysis shows that this is leading to a change in apparent time toward merger, and that the rate of vowel convergence is stronger among Chinese Americans than European Americans. The two speakers who produce flip-flop are seen to represent a key transitional generation with respect to the ethnic identity of the neighborhood, where flip-flop may be but one linguistic consequence of a lifetime of active negotiation between conflicting local meanings. The analysis suggests that ethnographic detail and attention to individual outliers allows for more comprehensive models of the range of phenomena associated with vowel mergers.},

    abstract = {Abstract WALS was designed with the goal of providing a “systematic answer” to questions about the geographical distribution of language features. In order to achieve this goal, there must be an adequate sample of the world's languages included in WALS. In this article we investigate to what extent WALS fulfils its aim of maximizing the genealogical diversity of the samples of languages included. For this we look at the core-200 sample (included on almost all maps) as well as the 1,370 sample for the feature OV/VO word order (the sample with the largest number of languages). The genealogical diversity in these samples is compared against a database of “what could have been done”, i.e., a database of which language families have adequate descriptive resources for the task at hand. In the 200 sample, we find a highly significant overinclusion of Eurasian languages at the expense of South American and Papuan languages. In the 1,370 sample, we find a highly significant overinclusion of North American languages at the expense of South American and Papuan languages. It follows that statistics based on these WALS samples cannot be used straightforwardly for sound inferences about the distribution of the features in question.},

Since there is no evidence of body-part terms in the base-6 forms attested, we speculate that these systems have a different origin. Specifically, we suggest that the base-6 systems arose for counting yams. The ethnographic data for Kanum and other relevant languages are in concord with such a scenario. Whether there is a historical connection with base-6 systems of the Kolopom languages, near, but not adjacent, to the west, remains an open question. If there is a connection, it is areal rather than genetic, but sufficient evidence for a pre-historic areal connection remains to be collected. Equally, if not more, puzzling would be the conclusion that there is no historical connection, given the rarity of base-6 in the world as a whole.},

There are proposals for a low level proto-language including Warndarrang and Marra, most commonly known as Proto-Marran.

    abstract = {Abstract 1. Introduction Structural categories of grammar (such as clitic, affix, compound, adjective, pronoun, dative, subject, passive, diphthong, coronal) have to be posited by linguists and by children during acquisition. This would be easier if they simply had to choose from a list of pre-established categories. However, existing proposals for what such a list might be are still heavily based on the Latin and English grammatical tradition. Thus, descriptive linguists still have no choice but to adopt the Boasian approach of positing special language-particular categories for each language. Theorists often resist it, but the crosslinguistic evidence is not converging on a smallish set of possibly innate categories. On the contrary, almost every newly described language presents us with some “crazy” new category that hardly fits existing taxonomies. Although there is thus no good evidence for pre-established categories, linguists still often engage in category-assignment controversies such as “Is the Tagalog ang-phrase a subject or a topic?'', “Is German er a pronoun or a determiner?'', “Are Mandarin Chinese property words adjectives or verbs?'', or “Is the Romanian definite article a clitic or a suffix?''},

    abstract = {The terms S (intransitive), A, P (transitive), as well as T and R (ditransitive) have been used since the 1970s to allow linguists to characterize the differences between major alignment patterns such as accusative vs. ergative. They are often taken for granted, but a closer examination of the literature reveals that they can have three rather different meanings: in the Dixonian approach, they are used as universal syntactic functions based on transitivity; in the Comrian approach, they are seen as comparative concepts for the two arguments of a typical action clause, and in the Bickelian approach, they are taken as generalized semantic roles (Dowtyan proto-roles). In this article, I explain the three approaches in some detail, and I argue that the Comrian approach is superior to the other two approaches. It is better than the Dixonian approach because it does not take an undefined transitivity notion for granted but defines transitivity in terms of A and P. It is also better than the Bickelian approach because the Dowtyan proto-roles were designed for the description of a particular class of English verbs; for crosslinguistic comparison, we need to limit ourselves to restricted (and semantically coherent) classes of verbs if we want to arrive at general statements.},

Upon closer examination of various pragmatic phenomena in discourse, however, it appears the situation is actually much more complex than the standard conceptualization of communication in pragmatics allows. In particular, it is suggested in this paper that the focus on expressing and recognizing/attributing (speaker) intentions underestimates the dynamic nature and complexity of cognition that underpins interaction. The notion of `dyadic cognizing' is thus introduced as a way of reconceptualizing the inferential work that underlies communication. It is suggested that such inferential work is `directed' and thus is inherently `intentional' in the sense proposed by Brentano, but need not necessarily be `directed' towards the `intentions' of speakers.},

The results suggest that the cognitive status of and word pairs as being the `same' or `different' is not entirely related to their production. This status could be affected by functional load: words that could lead to contextual ambiguity may seem more different than those for which the distinction is not functionally important. The results also provide evidence that an experimenter's dialect area can influence participants' production of these diphthongs. Participants in this study were met by two different experimenters from different dialect regions: New Zealand and the United States. Post hoc analysis reveals that participants who met with the US experimenter were more likely to maintain a distinction between the diphthongs than those who met with the NZ experimenter. Additionally, merged participants were more likely to report that and word pairs were distinct in their own speech if met by the US experimenter. Individuals from the US are more likely to maintain a distinction than speakers of NZE, so these results suggest that participants accommodate to the speech of an experimenter. We compare this finding with related results from a perception experiment completed by the same participants, presented in Hay, Warren, and Drager, (2006). While there appears to be a mismatch between results from production and perception, we interpret this as evidence that the observed effects are due to exposure to the experimenter and not to the distribution of participants across the different groups.},

The ability to distinguish the vowels is affected by a variety of factors for these listeners, including the likelihood that the speaker and experimenter maintain the distinction (Hay et al. 2006b; Hay et al. 2010). In this article, we report on experiments that examine the production and perception of real and nonsense words in the context of two mergers: the Ellen/Allan merger in New Zealand English and the lot/thought merger found in American English. The results demonstrate that speakers' degree of merger depends at least partially on whether the word is a real or nonsense word. Additionally, the results indicate that a token's real word status affects the merger differently in production and perception. We argue that these results provide evidence in favour of a hybrid model of speech production and perception, one with both abstract phoneme-level representations and acoustically detailed episodic representations.},

This paper provides an acoustic description of the Comanche vowel system based on recordings of six native speakers which suggests that Comanche /ɨ/ is actually a central mid vowel—not a high vowel. The discrepancy with the literature is attributed to three factors: a lack of prior acoustic research on Comanche, perceptual interference from the English language, and the prevalence of /ɨ/ in the literature on Numic languages. If other related languages turn out to require the reclassification of /ɨ/ as a mid vowel, this could have implications for the reconstruction of the Uto-Aztecan vowel system.},

A case is made for seven items of vocabulary, including vocabulary for maize, as loans from PNUA into PKT.

The availability of several forms raises the general questions of when and why speakers choose one variant over the other. The aim of this article is to identify factors of language structure and language use that underlie the comparative alternation and to determine their relative strengths on the basis of data from the BNC through a logistic regression analysis. The results suggest that the alternation is primarily governed by phonological factors, but that syntax and frequency of usage are of importance as well.},

Because these two nonfinite verbs thus share parts of their systems with nouns, with verbs, and with adjectives, I prefer to call them by the traditional name of “participle” and to eschew the term “nominalization”—even though the latter is widely accepted (see Carlin 2004:351, Derbyshire 1985:38, Gildea 1998:123, and Meira 1999:565). This paper has a double purpose. One is purely descriptive. Cariban linguistics needs careful and detailed descriptions of the complex sentence in all of the family's languages, and I considered it my duty to do my part for Carib (Gildea [forthcoming:sec. 5]). Second, close attention to descriptive detail unavoidably forced me into a modicum of theoretical discussion.},

    abstract = {Modern linguistic typology is increasingly less concerned with what is possible in human languages (universals) and increasingly more with the question “what's where why?'' (Bickel 2007). Moreover, as several recent papers in this journal show, typologists increasingly turn to quantitative approaches as a means to understanding typological distributions. In order to provide the quantitative study of typological distributions with a firm methodological foundation it is preferable to gain a grasp of simple facts before starting to ask the more complicated questions. In this article the only assumptions we make about languages are that (i) they may be partly described by a set of typological characteristics, each of which may either be found or not found in any given language; that (ii) languages may be genealogically related or not; and that (iii) languages are spoken in certain places. Given these minimal assumptions we can begin to ask how to express the differences and similarities among languages as functions of the geographical distances among them, whether different functions apply to genealogically related and unrelated languages, and whether it is possible to distinguish in some quantitative way between languages that are related and languages that are not, even when the languages in question are spoken at great distances from one another. Moreover, we may investigate the effects that factors such as ecology, migration, and rates of linguistic change or diffusion have on the degree of similarities among languages in cases where they are either related or unrelated. We will approach these questions from two perspectives. The first perspective is an empirical one, where observations primarily derive from analyses of the data of Haspelmath et al. (eds.) (2005). The second perspective is a computational one, where simulations are drawn upon to test the effects of different parameters on the development of structural linguistic diversity.},

The next significant collection of Chol lexicon was made in the late nineteenth century (Stoll [1884] 1938). The 1789 list is thus the only extensive source of Colonial Chol vocabulary (Bright 1967 and Hellmuth 1970). Here, the 1789 word list is examined and interpreted, with notes on the orthography of the original text, typographical errors in the published version, and the phonology and morphology of eighteenth-century Tila Chol. We compare all lexical items to modern Chol forms, noting obsolete or aberrant forms. While intelligibility with modern Chol is high, there is evidence of phonological, morphological, and semantic changes as well as lexical replacement over the past two centuries.},

    abstract = {In two recent handbook articles, Beckman & Venditti (2010, 2011) present overviews of tone and intonation which take issue with both traditional typology and recent attempts to bring clarity to the study of prosodic typology. In the course of their coverage Beckman & Venditti question the “usefulness” of distinguishing prosodic systems by “tonemic function alone” (e.g., lexical tone, stress, intonation) and raise the question “Is typology needed?'' Within this context I once again argue for a “property-driven” approach to prosodic typology whose goal is not to classify languages into prosodic types, rather to accurately characterize the same vs. different ways in which prosodic properties are exploited. We thus ask (i) whether a given language has word-level contrastive pitch (``tone''), word-level metrical structure (``stress''), both, or neither; (ii) if yes, what does the prosodic system do with the tones and/or stress, both at the word level and postlexically? Given the level-ordered nature of phonological systems, only after the first two questions are dealt with can we move on to the the question with which Beckman & Venditti are most concerned: (iii) how are the surface or output word-prosodic properties integrated with phrase- and utterance-level intonation? While Beckman & Venditti question the usefulness of “broad-stroke typologies” which have traditionally distinguished tone, stress, and intonation, their disposition to minimize systemic differences in favor of surface comparisons of phonetic realizations raises important questions concerning levels of representation and the nature of phonological typology itself.},

    abstract = {The field of linguistic typology, a centuries-old enterprise, is showing extraordinary new vitality and growth. While it fell somewhat to the wayside during the early generative period, linguists of all persuasions now acknowledge the importance of the study of all aspects of comparative grammar: phonetics, phonology,morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse. The significance of typology to both synchronic and diachronic linguistics is also widely recognized. Crosslinguistic work figures centrally in formal, functional, and cognitive approaches to linguistic theory, as well as in descriptive and historical research. The quest for linguistic universals and the documentation of linguistic diversity, once thought to be logically independent (if indeed not contradictory) concerns, are typically integrated in current research. The dramatic rebirth and increase of interest in linguistic diversity is in part fueled by the commitment of linguists and others in the scholarly community to the documentation and preservation of endangered languages. The interdisciplinary and increasingly joint efforts between geneticists, linguists, archeologists etc. in tracing the exodus of the human population from Africa and into other parts of the world relies heavily on the expertise of specialists of languages from all parts of the world.},

On the other hand, there has been a tendency for subsequent discussions and textbooks on linguistic typology to underrepresent and even ignore phonology, e.g., Whaley (1997). This is unfortunate not only because phonological typology is of importance in itself, but also because the approach of phonologists to typology might serve as a model for others to emulate. The main points I would like to make in this brief note are the following:(i) Phonological typology involves the comparative study of linguistic systems – i.e., paradigmatic and syntagmatic properties of inputs, outputs, and their relations. While phonological typology and phonetic typology are sometimes not distinguished, a surface inventory is not a system in the sense intended here.(ii) There is no clear division between phonological typology and phonological theory. Given their shared concern with the nature of phonological systems, one can't do insightful typology without addressing the same analytical issues that confront phonological theory. Throughout the history of phonology, the two have been inseparable both in principle and in practice.},

Comrie and Thompson (2007:379) claim that there are no formal distinctions between nominalization and relativization in certain languages, while Shibatani further argues that what have been mistakenly identified as relative clauses in some languages are in fact nominalizations, since they are neither syntactically nor semantically dependent on the nominal head they modify (2009:163). This paper establishes that Chimariko, an extinct language of Northern California, uses clausal nominalization as a relativization strategy, similar to what has been found for Diegueño, Mojave, Wappo, Quechua, and many other languages. In Chimariko, relative clauses are subordinate restrictive clauses which are either internally headed or headless. They include the four characteristics expected in relative clause constructions (Keenan 1985): (1) they are sentence-like; (2) they consist of a head noun (present or inferred) and a relative clause; (3) they have a total of two predicates; and (4) they describe or delimit an argument. However, the verbal suffix marking dependency in these clauses could be interpreted either as a relativizer or as a clausal nominalizer paralleling constructions found in Diegueño and many other languages. Functionally, these constructions represent relative clauses given that they are restrictive.},

Chimariko is a polysynthetic language with a complex verb morphology which follows a hierarchical system, as well as an agent–patient distinction, in the marking of core arguments. There are no obvious complementizers, and putative complements are never marked as arguments on a predicate. The semantic concepts expressed by complements in some languages are coded in Chimariko (1) as separate clauses with no reduction of the predicates or any other restrictions or (2) as an integral part of the verbal morphology. By applying Noonan's analysis of semantic classes of complement-taking predicates to Chimariko, I demonstrate that this language represents a counterexample to the universality claim that all languages have complementation.},

    abstract = {Proposed criteria for defining nominal compounds cross-linguistically are not universally accepted. Moreover, in some languages, nominal compounds share properties with phrases and possessive constructions and are not easily identified in all instances (Aikhenvald 2007, Bauer 2006; 2009, Lieber and Štekauer 2009, and Scalise and Vogel 2010). This paper examines the phonological, morphosyntactic, and semantic properties of nominal compounds in Chuxnabán Mixe and argues that defining criteria for compoundhood are best viewed language-specifically. In Chuxnabán Mixe, nominal compounds are best discerned phonologically. In addition, they are distinct morphosyntactically by being treated as a whole for inflection and by showing a fixed order with respect to their parts. This work further establishes that nominal compounding is a productive word-formation process in Chuxnabán Mixe. While nominal compounding has been noted in Mesoamerican (Campbell, Kaufman, and Smith-Stark 1986) and other Mixean languages (Romero-Méndez 2008, Ruiz de Bravo Ahuja 1980, Schoenhals and Schoenhals 1982, and Van Haitsma and Van Haitsma 1976), there are no studies examining its formal properties or its productivity, possibly due to the fact that nominal compounding is a lesser-studied topic in polysynthetic languages where most information is encoded in verbs.

    abstract = {It can easily be observed in analysing natural language discourse that the category of an indexical expression does not correspond to clearly delimited types of expressions: in spite of the philosophers' rigid distinctions into directly referring expressions and expressions whose referring function is present on only some occasions of use (where, for example, indexicals and proper names belong to the first category and definite descriptions to the latter), the devices that natural languages use for the purpose of conveying reference cannot be easily put into this mould. At the same time, these rigid classifications, such as those informing Kaplan's content/character distinction, rely on a formal semanticists' dubious assumption that expressions can be identified and classified prior to the function they have in a particular context. So, for example, for Kaplan, personal pronouns have characters (sometimes referred to as `linguistic meanings') that are in need of contextual specification before the truth-conditional semantic analysis (in terms of a function from possible words/circumstances of evaluation to truth values) gives them content. However, what counts as character is arguably itself context-dependent: the unit that is relevant for such a contextual specification is in itself dependent on the particular situation of discourse, and even, arguably, on the speaker's intentions. It is therefore proposed that Kaplan's character/content distinction be `pragmaticized' accordingly, to apply to such a flexible, use-driven category. In short, characters become `fluid' because they correspond to `flexible' inferential bases.},

Preamble On a personal level, the appearance in 1997 of Linguistic Typology (or LT henceforth), as the official journal of the Association for Linguistic Typology (or ALT henceforth), could not have been more timely. I thought that it augured well for the book that I had just started to write (i.e., Song 2001).When I completed my PhD (in linguistic typology) in the early 1990s, a well-known linguist (whose name I am not at liberty to reveal) confided to me that all that needed to be discovered in linguistic typology had been discovered, and that not many would hang around to do (any more) linguistic typology. I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had for some time harboured the uneasy feeling that perhaps I might have committed myself to something that would soon go out of fashion, if not existence – which is understandable given the unidentified linguist's reputation and my status as a fresh PhD graduate. However, the establishment in 1994 of the ALT, together with the advent of LT, gave me all the encouragement that I needed to proceed with the writing of the book. As a matter of fact, if the quality and the quantity of the articles published in LT over the years are anything to go by (not to mention major publications such as The World Atlas of Language Structures (or WALS), the EUROTYP series, Language Typology and Language Universals: An International Handbook, and the forthcoming The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Typology), the linguist who expressed his pessimism about the future of linguistic typology couldn't have got it more wrong.},

It offers a detailed analysis of these positionals and compares their use with other Siouan and some non-Siouan languages. While positional stance verbs also double as positional auxiliaries in many languages of the world, in Biloxi positional auxiliaries are grammaticized variants of what were once physical stance verbs, evidenced by the fact that the positional auxiliaries no longer take pronominal marking and sometimes occur side-by-side with their physical stance counterparts. This is a typologically interesting situation in which positional auxiliary verbs form a discrete series distinct from positional stance verbs. The proper use of positional verbs is a complex aspect of the grammar of Biloxi and other Siouan languages. While the choice of positional verbs is often logically motivated based on an object's salient axial extension or shape, this analysis demonstrates that, particularly in more abstract cases, the proper choice of positional auxiliary is not at all obvious. Discrepancies in choice of positional, even among closely related languages and even in the same language, are highlighted. [Keywords: Biloxi, Siouan, positional, auxiliary verb]},

The aim of the present article is to challenge this assumption. It will be demonstrated that a great many fully acceptable uses of proforms turn out to be quite problematic for the view of proforms as corresponding either to constituents or to semantic and/or syntactic units in underlying representation; nor, it turns out, do proforms necessarily refer to or denote a single (identifiable, retrievable or inferrable) entity. After a brief summary of the relevant literature, the article presents a detailed examination of the actual function and use of English proforms, focusing on a number of frequently used proforms: (i) the indefinite pronoun one, (ii) the predicative proform do so, (iii) the demonstrative pronouns that and those and (iv) certain uses of the personal pronouns we/us and you. On the basis of attested examples, it is argued that these proforms do not necessarily express a unit at any level of underlying representation. Instead an alternative account of the use of proforms is suggested, using the theory of Functional Discourse Grammar, which, with its four different levels of analysis (representing pragmatic, semantic, morphosyntactic and phonological information), possesses the kind of flexibility needed to deal with English proforms in a consistent and unified manner. Finally, an attempt is made to explain some of the constraints on the flexible system proposed.},

    abstract = {The present article discusses the development of adverbial -ing clauses, so-called `converb clauses', in English. We argue that Middle English does not have a category of truly subordinate adverbial clauses in -ing, but that such clauses have developed on the basis of semi-coordinate -ing clauses denoting an accompanying circumstance or exemplification/specification. In the course of the Middle English period, such clauses began to be reinterpreted as clauses expressing adverbial relations such as time, condition, cause, purpose, etc. Another likely source of converb clauses is participial relative clauses. We see the development of converb clauses as an instance of grammaticalization, as it involves the development of a grammatical means of expressing a rhetorical function, viz. the `Nucleus-Satellite' relation (Mathiessen & Thompson 1988). This grammaticalization process also involves subjectification, given that the source constructions are propositional, while time and cause clauses have textual and expressive functions/meanings. The grammaticalization process was probably also fed by other participial structures – notably the progressive and the gerund, which were being grammaticalized at the same time – and also nonclausal adverbial structures.},

In this article, we show that neither of these two previous perspectives captures the variations and flexibility of the construction in question satisfactorily. Our approach adopts the view that degree words are functors selecting their head, and attributes the peculiarities to the interactions between the lexical properties of the degree items and the constructional constraints in question.},

    abstract = {This paper examines Differential R Marking (DRM) – i.e., the effects of animacy on the encoding of goals (R), as in `a linguist sent a book to the phonetician/to the town' – from a crosslinguistic perspective. The phenomenon comprises three types, which are distinguished based on whether R can be marked in the same way as the transitive Patient or not (animate Rs usually allow this, while inanimate Rs usually surface as obliques). Even though DRM shares common features with Differential Object Marking (DOM), the two phenomena cannot be explained by the same functions. The findings of this article support the view that differences in object coding (comprising both DRM and DOM) are best explained by affectedness rather than ambiguity avoidance.},

    abstract = {A number of nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century dialect descriptions refer to an unusual adverb + infinitive construction in southwestern and west Midlands dialects of English. The construction is most often reported in the form of a formulaic phrase away to go, meaning `away he went', though it is also found with a range of other adverbs. In addition, the same dialects also make use of a possibly related imperative construction, consisting of a preposition or adverb and a to-infinitive, as in out to come! `Come out!' and a negative imperative construction consisting of the negator not and the base form of the verb, as in Not put no sugar in!. These construction types appear to be marginal at best in earlier varieties of English, whereas comparable constructions with the verbal noun are a well-established feature of especially British Celtic languages (i.e. Welsh, Breton, and Cornish). In this article I argue that transfer from the British Celtic languages offers a possible explanation for the use of these constructions in the traditional southwestern and west Midlands dialects of English.},

In this article, I give a systematic analysis of the phonetics and phonology of Early Shetland Scots in comparison to Norn and mainland Scots dialects. The Shetland Scots data are largely consistent with theoretical expectations, lending further support to the new-dialect reading of the dialect's diachronic development.},

Whereas the variable use of SPPs in Turkish has been extensively analyzed in many studies conducted in Europe, it has received much less attention in the US. One of the aims of the present study is to replicate the study conducted by Otheguy et al., where the influence of different social and linguistic variables on the expression of Spanish SPPs was examined across Latin American and Caribbean immigrant generations in NYC. The present study is part of a dissertation that examined several linguistic and social variables that condition the presence and absence of SPPs in the speech of 20 adult speakers living in Turkey and 20 living in NYC, but reports here only the results regarding the rates of use of overt SPPs in Turkish and the effects of continuity of reference on the use of SPPs. In both the TT and TNY samples, there were an equal number of males and females. The speakers ranged in age from 20 to 80 years old. The results of the study indicate that there was an increase in the use of overt SPPs in both the same- and different-reference environments among the TNY and a significantly higher rate of overt SPP use for TNY than for TT. These findings are consistent with those obtained in the work by Otheguy et al.},

Moreover, although kinship terms share properties with both verbs and nouns, they also have a more typical “nominal” function in that they semantically identify a member of the kinship relation as referent rather than denote the relation itself. This lexical specification of a relation member as the word's index argues against an internally headed relative clause analysis of the kinship terms.},

The verb class markers -ta- and -pa-, I argue, are verbalizers of precategorial roots, while -da- and -wa- are shown to serve, among other functions, as anticausativizers. The contrast in the two broad classes of verb class marker is shown to have significant consequences for the lexical semantics, syntax, and morphology of verbs in the language, leading to an understanding of a range of previously poorly understood and undocumented facts of the language.},

    abstract = {Abstract 1. Introduction Although the term “lexical typology” is often used as if it were self-explanatory there is not much consensus on what exactly it can refer to, apart from the evident fact that it involves crosslinguistic research on the lexicon. Many linguists will probably agree with Lehrer's (1992: 249) widely quoted definition that lexical typology is concerned with the “characteristic ways in which language […] packages semantic material into words” (cf. the overviews in Koch 2001 and Brown 2001). This would make lexical typology a sub-branch of semantic typology concerned with the lexicon, where semantic typology, in the definition of Evans (forthcoming), is “the systematic cross-linguistic study of how languages express meaning by way of signs”. Other definitions of lexical typology, clinging to the apparently safer interface with grammar, focus on “typologically relevant features in the grammatical structure of the lexicon” (Lehmann 1990: 163) or on typologically relevant vs. language-specific patterns of the lexicon-grammar interaction (Behrens & Sasse 1997).},

The paper highlights some difficulties with a purely negative definition of a third-person pronoun (i.e. neither speaker nor spoken to) before advancing a positive definition which seeks to build on certain advances that the negative definition afforded. Crucial to this positive definition is the interaction of third-person pronouns in the extended animacy hierarchy posited by Croft. The particular participation in the extended animacy hierarchy by third-person pronouns accounts for the diversity evidenced cross-linguistically, from sharing morphological traits with first- and second-person pronouns to having demonstrative–anaphoric multifunctionality in which demonstratives have both deictic and anaphoric functions.},

A new proposal is then presented, which explains the facts in a more direct way than previous theses. I argue that phonemicisation of a previous allophonic voice alternation in fricatives had already taken place in many areas of Anglo-Saxon England through language contact with Brittonic. Voiceless as well as voiced fricative phonemes existed in Brittonic at the time of contact, and language shift would have led directly to the phonemicisation of the previous allophonic variation found in early Old English.},

In addition to the earlier meaning of gay being `happy', `carefree' and `frivolous' (1st meaning), and to a later meaning of gay being synonymous with `homosexual' (2nd meaning), it appears that gay is now being understood by young people to mean `stupid', `lame' or `boring', as in `That shirt is so gay', or `How gay is that?' (3rd meaning). Two studies were performed to ascertain who is aware of this new meaning of gay within contemporary Australian society (Study 1) and to examine the 3rd meaning in more detail, by focussing on how young people from Canberra (Australia), aged 18–30, currently understand the word gay (Study 2). The results of Study 1 showed that the word gay functions as a sociolinguistic variable with older people (60+) being more likely to interpret gay as having the 1st meaning, whereas younger people (18--30 year olds) were more likely to interpret gay as having the 3rd meaning. The results of Study 2 showed that young people (18--30 year olds) understand the meaning of gay differently depending upon whether the subject is animate (e.g. `he', `she') or inanimate (e.g. `that film'); whether it is used with the verb `to look' or the copula `to be'; and whether the word gay is used in conjunction with the intensifier so (e.g. `They're gay' compared to `They're so gay'). Gay was more likely to be interpreted in the negative 3rd meaning in sentences with an inanimate subject. Studying this new meaning of the word gay is important for understanding semantic change and discovering current language trends in contemporary Australian English.},

The opposition between the indicative and attributive modes has remained poorly understood until now. In our discussion, we clarify it in terms of the interpretation of la and also explain the distribution of la in negative verbal forms and in imperatives.

It will argue that instances of language use in communication (linguistic acts) are inseparable from the cultural context in which they are created and in which they are received. Culture impacts on communication at a number of levels. It constitutes a frame in which utterances are conveyed and interpreted: what is communicated depends as much on the cultural context in which the communication occurs as it does on the elements from which the linguistic act is constructed. Culture also influences how the linguistic act itself is constructed, affecting text types and the properties and purposes of textual structures. Aspects of communication such as sequencing, recipient design and impact are read within a framework of cultural understandings about valued and appropriate language use. In addition, culture has an impact on understanding the purpose of a linguistic act in instances of communication. It influences perceptions of the communicative purpose associated with particular types of linguistic acts at particular moments of interaction and also of the interactional and interpersonal value of linguistic acts. Finally culture is a feature of the form of the language which is used to construct linguistic acts. Languages are, at least in part, culturally constructed artefacts which encode conceptual understandings of the world at various levels of embeddedness. The culturally contexted nature of communication therefore imposes a problem of inter-translatability for actual instances of communication across languages and cultures and necessitates a level of particularity for each actual instance of communication.},

    abstract = {This study is an acoustic–phonetic examination of variation in Australian English consonant production. Group and individual patterns in the rates of frication of the voiceless plosives /p t k/ in Australian English are investigated. Previous studies on voiceless plosive production in Australian English have focussed primarily on /t/, and these analyses have largely been auditory in nature. Further, whereas previous studies have focussed on describing sociophonetic variation within Australian English, this study investigates speaker-specific variation. An analysis of twin speech, produced by young adult male speakers from Melbourne, is presented. The speakers are three identical twin pairs and one non-identical twin pair. The reason for studying twins, and identical twins in particular, is to explore the degree of phonetic difference between pairs of individuals who, theoretically, are as anatomically similar as possible and whose educational levels and home lives have been relatively the same. The speakers were recorded separately, engaging in spontaneous conversation with the first author in two sessions each. All /p t k/ tokens were categorized as fricated or closed using acoustic waveforms and wideband spectrograms. While /t/ was rarely fricated by any speaker, /p/ and /k/ exhibited a wide range of variation in the proportions of tokens fricated, both between speakers, and within twin pairs. Further, each individual's proportions of /p/ and /k/ tokens fricated were relatively consistent across the two recording sessions. Implications of these findings for descriptions of Australian English and theories of speaker characteristics are discussed.},

    abstract = {A non-standard form of the definite article is used by upwards of a million speakers every day and yet it has received little attention in terms of a phonological analysis. The most recent discussions have been a historical and contemporary survey, spectrographic investigations and sociolinguistic surveys. It is clearly a complex issue and has relevance to a number of theoretical questions, some of which are rarely addressed. We need to know the range of phonetic forms; the phonological distribution of the forms; the historical development and whether this helps with a synchronic analysis; and the number and nature of the lexical storage forms. The distribution varies between localities and between speakers; many speakers also use standard English the. The historical development is not at all clear, but does throw some light on what the synchronic grammars should be like. There appears to be a break between those grammars in which the phonetic forms of the definite article are predictable in terms of the phonological environment and those later grammars that have lexically specific forms. The changes that have taken place cannot be explained in terms of simple system-internal mechanisms and some knowledge of the sociohistorical background to the emergence of the new grammars is necessary. This article looks at historical sources from the mid seventeenth century onwards to try to determine the changes that have taken place in the northern dialects concerned, and proposes population movements and expansion as a determining factor in the changes that are in evidence. One possible scenario in terms of new-dialect formation during the nineteenth century is suggested. For the modern variants polysystemic, declarative grammars are proposed, with the possibility of grammar-switching under certain circumstances, such as repair or interaction with outsiders.},

In the new, rigid subject-verb-object syntax, the function of preposed constituents changed, and the function of encoding `old' or `given' information in a pragmatically neutral way was increasingly reserved for subjects. Pressure from information structure to repair this situation subsequently led to the rise of new passive constructions in order to satisfy the need for more subjects; the change in the informational status of preposed constituents triggered the rise of clefts. If information structure can be compromised by syntactic change in this way, this suggests that it represents a separate linguistic level outside the syntax.},

    abstract = {The evolution of verbs expressing necessity in the history of English, such as *þurfan and need, has been studied in detail, especially their semantic competition and their grammaticalization (see Molencki 2002, 2005; Taeymans 2006; Loureiro-Porto 2009). However, analogous verbo-nominal expressions involving the morphologically related nouns þearf and need and the verbs be and have have received little attention, despite their relevance as semantic competitors of the verbs and their subsequent fossilization in high-frequency expressions such as if need be and had need. The current article fills this gap by studying the development of verbo-nominal expressions with þearf and need from Old to early Modern English, and asks: (i) whether the verbs and the verbo-nominal expressions undergo similar processes of grammaticalization, and (ii) whether there is any connection between the evolution of the verbal and the verbo-nominal sets. Analysis of these verbo-nominal constructions in a 4.1 million-word corpus (including the Helsinki Corpus and fragments of the Dictionary of Old English Corpus, the Corpus of Middle English Prose and Verse, the Lampeter Corpus and the Corpus of Early English Correspondence Sampler) shows that, firstly, both idiomaticization and grammaticalization are relevant in the development of verbo-nominal constructions; secondly, their evolution is key to the understanding of the development of the necessity verbs *þurfan and need; and finally, the competition between constructions with þearf and need calls into question the well-known hypothesis that phonological confusion with durran caused the disappearance of *þurfan in the ME period (see Visser 1963–73: 1423, §1343).},

Primary focus is on (i) a straightforward negator use that in prescriptively approved varieties of English has an aspectual restriction to non-chance, completive achievement predicates in the preterite, but no such restriction in nonstandard English; and (ii) a distinct categorical-denial use that quantifies over possible perspectives on a situation. Against Cheshire (1998), it is argued that neither of these uses represents continuity with non-temporal uses of never in Middle English, but both are instead relatively recent innovations resulting from semantic reanalysis and the semanticization of implicatures.},

It focuses on a certain region, that of the Southern Lowlands, mainly Anglo-Saxon Wessex, and deals with evidence that has been mentioned before: (1) the twofold paradigm of `to be' and (2) the Old English designations for Celts that refer to their status as slaves. The article demonstrates that both the syntactic and the lexico-semantic evidence is particularly concentrated in West Saxon texts. Together, both types of evidence are shown to support the assumption that a very substantial Celtic population exerted substratal influence on (pre-)Old English by way of large-scale language shift in one of the early heartlands of England. This substratal Insular Celtic influence on Old English is contrasted with the adstratal Celtic influence on continental West Germanic.},

We also consider the processes of reflexivization and reciprocalization and demonstrate that one object of a ditransitive verb can be reflexivized or reciprocalized while the other controls object agreement.

There may be some language internal factors at work, but influence from English is a likely cause for this change. The youngest speaker was born before the Māori language revitalization programme was established. The results provide a snapshot of the pronunciation of Māori stops before the development of the kōhanga reo revitalization movement (Māori language nests) in 1982.},

    abstract = {In Chimila, nasal consonants contrast with voiced stops at the same point of articulation and no surface phonetic contrast occurs between nasalized and oral vowels in core lexemes. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicate that the Chimila lexicon includes nasal morphemes in contrast with oral morphemes. Evidence for this contrast includes morphophonemic alternations of stem-forming verb suffixes, appearance of a glottal glide following intransitive verb roots that have been transitivized, allomorphs of the intransitive imperative, and a restricted alternation between word-initial voiced stops and nasal consonants in roots and some suffixes. A constraint requiring lexical nasality to attach to consonants in core lexemes and the interaction of this constraint with the prosodic system, lexical tone, syllable structure, and the morphology account for the varied manifestations of lexical nasality.},

It is demonstrated that Cupeño unaccented roots predominantly derive from Proto-Uto-Aztecan etyma with second-syllable stress and were also stressed on the peninitial syllable in Cupeño's immediate predecessor, Proto-Cupan. It is argued that the behavior of unaccented roots is an archaism that can be accounted for by common cross-linguistic strategies of metrification prevalent in Proto-Cupan. These processes are no longer operative in Cupeño but appear to be mirrored by principles governing secondary stress assignment in Cahuilla, a closely related language.},

Variation is examined in casual conversations between young, intimate interlocutors and observations are supported by interviews with conversation participants. Results show speakers select pronominal forms prescribed by Indonesian grammars as well as forms drawn from Arabic and colloquial Indonesian associated with speakers from the capital Jakarta. Pronouns are shown to be selected to enact stances related to, among other things, solidarity, epistemic authority, playfulness and the mitigation of fact-threatening acts. A concluding discussion outlines how young Indonesian speakers use these stances to construct heterogeneous selves, concerned with youth, nation and religion.},

Those working on Creek have rarely agreed on the number of tenses or on their meanings, however, and have rarely examined the seemingly intricate ways that speakers use tenses in texts. This paper argues that Creek has one future tense and five past tenses. It finds, however, that speakers may cast events within a single time frame in several different tenses based on immediacy. That is, just as English speakers will sometimes use present tense in describing past events, Creek speakers will sometimes allow tenses to creep forward from past 5 (remote past) to past 4 or even past 3 as events become more vivid. The Creek data thus provide especially clear support for observations that temporal distance in language may be extended metaphorically to express subjective distance (Dahl 1984, Fleischman 1989, and Hintz 2007).},

The discourse analysis involved the application of Pierrehumbert & Hirschberg's compositional theory of tune meaning. The study appears to support key aspects of Pierrehumbert & Hirschberg's theory: the results show overwhelmingly that the speakers used high (H*) pitch accents with new information and low (L*) pitch accents with information that was already part of the speaker and hearer's mutual beliefs. The findings suggest that the individual tones in a HRT each contribute to the overall meaning of an intonation contour, and that a close examination of intonation features within a developing communication context is crucial to understanding intonational meaning.},

The paper is concerned with identifying the motivations. It is proposed, based on an investigation of uses in a corpus of narrative and other texts, that two features are relevant: (a) semantic—the subject is highly agentive; and (b) referential—the identity of the subject is not predictable: it is unexpected. Use of the ergative on an intransitive subject thus highlights both the agentivity and the unexpectedness of the subject. I argue that, contrary to recent claims by some, Warrwa is not an active language: it is not the case that -na∼-ma groups together some intransitive and transitive subjects, while zero marking groups some intransitive subjects with transitive objects; these groupings are, I argue, purely formal and epiphenomenal. Finally, I situate optional marking of intransitive subjects in Warrwa in a wider theory of optional case marking.},

That Welsh and Cornish borrowed the construction from English is impossible given its presence in Breton, whose speakers left Britain in the fifth century. The paucity of Celtic loanwords in English is paralleled by equivalent paucity in undisputed contact cases such as Uralic's on Russian.

    abstract = {Gurindji Kriol is a mixed language spoken by Gurindji people at Kalkaringi in northern Australia. It has retained many of the features of Gurindji including case-marking, many other nominal suffixes (inflectional and derivational) and significant portions of vocabulary (including nouns and coverbs). It has also lost many features of Gurindji including inflecting verbs and bound pronouns. Other systems have also been significantly affected by language contact. For example, although the Gurindji cardinal direction system is in evidence, it is greatly reduced both inflectionally and functionally. Where the paradigm of Gurindji cardinals contains 28 inflected forms for each cardinal direction and these are used pervasively to describe large and small-scale space, Gurindji Kriol contains at most four inflected forms for each cardinal direction and they are only used for descriptions of large-scale space. Despite this reduction in the use of Gurindji cardinal directions, Gurindji Kriol has not replaced or supplemented this system with Kriol cardinal terms or with the English left/right system. Instead Gurindji Kriol favours deictic terms and gesture to express spatial relations. Yet deixis and gesture are only useful in so far as the speaker and hearer can see each other. The final part of this paper presents the results of a `Man and tree' task which was conducted at Kalkaringi with 11 Gurindji Kriol participants and six Gurindji participants. The task was designed specifically to reveal strategies of spatial description in small-scale space where the speaker's and hearer's view of each other is obscured. What emerges from this test is the pervasive use of cardinal directions and the suggestion that the mental map of younger Gurindji people is still based on fixed bearings despite the paucity of cardinal directions in natural discourse.},

We identify several related, but distinct, ablaut patterns and reconstruct them to sources in two Proto-Carib morphemes, *i- `3' and *j- `Relational Prefix'. This then leads us to ervise prior reconstructions of certain personmarking prefixes in Proto-Carib, as well as many vowel-initial lexical items, a few *j- initial lexical items, and two Proto-Carib derivational morphemes. A number of these reconstructions appear to support prior claims of distant genetic relationship between the Cariban and Tupian families.},

A re-examination of the arguments for early phonemicization leads to alternative interpretations of the observed voicing `irregularities' in Old English. The empirical core of the article presents the patterns of alliteration in Old and Middle English; this kind of evidence has not been previously considered in evaluating the progress of the change. The analytical core of the article is dedicated to the dynamics of categorization based on edge vs domain-internal contrasts, the relative strength of the voicing environments, and the distinction among fricatives depending on place of articulation. A comprehensive LAEME and MED database of all relevant forms reaffirms the traditional position regarding French influence for the phonemicization of voicing for the labial fricatives. The categorization of the contrast for the interdental fricatives is a language-internal prosodic process, and the history of the sibilants requires reference to both external and internal factors. The shift from a predominantly complementary to a predominantly contrastive distribution of the voiced–voiceless fricative pairs has been occurring at different rates for a whole millennium. The claim that phonemicization is attributable to Celtic influence in Old English is empirically and theoretically unsubstantiated.},

    abstract = {This article explores the motivations behind the loss of a number of Germanic prefixes in the history of English. Using Old and Middle English translations of Boethius' de Consolatione Philosophiae as a corpus, it is shown that prefix loss is not specific to a single word category, nor to the presence of morphosyntactic characteristics such as prefix separability. This state of affairs cannot be explained by current theories of prefix loss, which are generally restricted to inseparable verbal prefixes. The fact that some prefixes are lost and some are preserved, also argues against an across-the-board grammaticalisation account, based mostly on semantic factors. It is held here that a closer look at the prosodic structure of native prefixes can provide a principled explanation for the entirety of our data. To this effect, the optimisation of a resolved moraic trochee (Dresher & Lahiri, 1991) amid significant restructuring of the language's lexicon had crucial impact on the fate of prefixed words. In particular, Early Middle English would have come to prefer maximal, branching feet, and avoid words with prefixes constituting heavy, non-branching feet. Ultimately, the preservation of prosodic structure led to the loss of heavy monosyllabic prefixes due to stress clash between prefix and root. Light monosyllabic and bisyllabic prefixes, in contrast, were preserved, since no clash occurred. This argument explains the changes in prefixation from a purely prosodic standpoint, hence accounting for the data for both verbal and nominal prefixes, which were heretofore dealt with separately.},

    abstract = {The factors governing word order in binomials, i.e. coordinated word pairs of the same word class, have been the subject of discussion for a long time in linguistics. For example, why do we say law and order but not order and law? The article tests seventeen different potential ordering constraints that have previously been suggested, from the areas of semantics, phonology and word frequency, by checking over 500 high-frequency binomials extracted from the BNC against them. A clear hierarchy of constraints is suggested following the analysis of their success in predicting binomial order. In addition, however, attention is drawn to the reversibility status of binomials. The vast majority of English binomials is reversible to a smaller or larger degree. Reversibility scores were computed for all binomials in the sample so that the relationship between reversibility on the one hand and the adherence to the ordering constraints on the other could be analysed, finding that a number of semantic and metrical ordering constraints indeed increase their predictive success towards the frozen end of the reversibility cline. Complying with these constraints, then, increases the likelihood of a binomial to be less reversible. Claims for the influence of certain factors on the freezing process are thus substantiated for the first time.},

Newly assessed linguistic evidence suggests that the proposed Eastern Ch'olan innovations supporting the Classic Ch'olti'an hypothesis may in fact be shared retentions from Proto-Ch'olan-Tzeltalan and Proto-Ch'olan. This paper also reviews the proposals for the identification of Eastern Ch'olan and Western Ch'olan vernacular markers at a variety of ancient cities by Justeson and Fox (1989) and Lacadena and Wichmann (2002), among others, and suggests that the late and geographically circumscribed appearance of these traits indicates that Proto-Ch'olan had not fully diversified—into distinct languages—by the end of the Classic period. It is concluded that it was a form of Pre-Ch'olan or Proto-Ch'olan that served as the basis for the standardization of Classic Lowland Mayan writing during the Late Preclassic period, by a.d. 200, and that the diversification of Proto-Ch'olan was more likely a Postclassic (a.d. 900–1521) phenomenon, one exacerbated by the political and demographic collapse at the end of the Classic period.},

    abstract = {This paper offers a novel approach to the classical referential categories described for Plains Cree (Algonquian), paying particular attention to the notions of “animate obviative” and “inanimate obviative.'' Based on the asymmetric morphological expression of these two proposed categories, I argue that the term “obviative” ought not to be applied equally to animate and inanimate, and that the grammatical category “inanimate obviative” is not relevant for Plains Cree. A compositional approach is developed instead, which demonstrates that the semantic and syntactic properties of “obviative” are predictable from the properties of the elements that construct them. So the grammatical category “obviative” is a property of constructions but not of particular morphosyntactic elements. I then consider the typological implications of this discussion, both for Algonquian and cross-linguistically.},

We give a detailed account of this unique reported speech system, its relationship to the evidential system, and the broader implications for theories of reported discourse. In relation to the evidential system, all past events learned through inference or speech must encode the point of view of an event's detection, and in turn the context of the reporting of that event, the only exception being that community elders may make direct indexical reference to unobserved past events within a “Narrative Past” construction used exclusively for recounting oral history.},

In section 5 I compare Kentish Sermon genitive phrases to corresponding phrases in the French original. There is evidence that a particular genitive function was strongly influenced by French models, but the system as a whole has its origins in the transition from Old to Middle English.},

This article argues that so-called category-determining prefixation is a V (Verb)-to-V prefixation which takes denominal and deadjectival converted verbs as inputs, and thus special treatment is unwarranted. The hypothesis that conversion underlies N (Noun)/A (Adjective)-to-V prefixation is examined from both diachronic and synchronic perspectives. Diachronically, it is shown that the prefixes in question all started as non-category-determining V-to-V prefixes, and their N/A-to-V usage was established only in Modern English. With the constant productivity of conversion in the history of English, N/A-to-V usage can emerge from V-to-V usage. Synchronically, denominal/deadjectival prefixed verbs are shown to exhibit input and output properties that prove the above hypothesis: they have a converted counterpart; they are subject to the same morphological constraints as converted verbs; and their semantics is equivalent to the semantics of converted verbs modified by the semantics of V-to-V prefixation. It is concluded that there is no derivational prefix that determines the output category in English.},

Voice-related constructions are much more strongly associated with the potential than with the necessitive, and the source constructions are overwhelmingly passive and spontaneous voice. Accordingly, a grammaticalization path from passive and spontaneous to potential can be posited. Furthermore, it was found that the expression of modality with non-canonical case marking patterns often originates in, or is associated with, possessive constructions, usually resulting in necessitive constructions. Possible motivations and contexts for the development of the constructions under investigation are suggested.},

There are also terms for intermediate directions and probably sea and land breezes, and terms relatable to the sun and tides. A recent treatment of the wind direction data by Gibson, who draws as well on work by Troy, interprets the records as indicating that some word meanings shift so much according to context that he questions whether the Sydney Language had words at all. However, there is order discernible here, fitting with regional evidence for the salience of cardinal directions. The main four directions may have been aligned to axes offset from the cardinal directions, or else participate in a kind of location-dependent quarter-turn rotation.

The article spotlights the ceremonial `official language' status of South Africa's nine African languages and the `national language' status of the Ndebele language in Zimbabwe. It is argued that contrary to rosy policy enunciations, actual patterns of language use and discursive practices of ruling political elites confer higher functional status to English and Afrikaans in South Africa and English and Shona in Zimbabwe. Therefore, as well as being firmly located and resident in political statements of the ruling elites, language policy ideologies are also hidden in the fissures and faultlines of official documents. The article concludes that the documented language policies of South Africa and Zimbabwe epitomize lofty ideals that are not consonant with actual patterns of language use mediated and legitimized by hegemonic discourses of ruling politicians.},

Since previous research has shown that the use of person reference in Present-Day English is biased towards group distinction, linking positive characteristics to members of one's in-group and distancing people in the out-group with negative reference, it is probable that this was the case in historical language use as well.},

How does a `proposal' for a social visit arise from a course of talk, and how is it fitted both to its recipient and to the moment it occurs? How is the proposal understood to be `unsuccessful'? We show how turns at talk always emerge and are understood within the rich sequential context of a developing trajectory of interaction that is jointly developed by participants. Linguists are well placed to study communication as naturally occurring talk, and such study can in turn inform linguistics by developing knowledge of the nature and use of language.},

One is the structural complexity of the relative clause, which is calculated in part by counting the number of nodes dominating the trace or pronoun within the NP dominating the relative clause (see Hawkins 1994).

    abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of the word-level phonology of the San Mateo dialect of Huave, a language isolate of Mexico, is presented within the framework of lexical phonology (Kiparsky 1982 and Halle and Vergnaud 1987), based on my fieldwork as well as data from published sources, chiefly Stairs Kreger and Stairs (1981). Affixes and other morphological processes are shown to fall into three groups (cyclic, non-cyclic, and clitic), according to their phonological behavior. Numerous derivational opacities are exhibited and analyzed through ordered rules with both cyclic and non-cyclic modes of application. Other noteworthy phenomena include a pervasive contrast in consonantal secondary articulation interacting extensively with vowel place features; an autosegmental diminutivization process; reduplication and infixation; an unusually complex system of vowel harmony and vowel copying; and evidence for a lexical-difusion change in progress in vowel harmony classes.

    abstract = {This article presents data on the acquisition of the low back vowel contrast by native speakers of Canadian English who have moved as adults to the New York City region, examining how these speakers who natively possess a single low back vowel category have acquired the low back vowel distinction of the new ambient dialect. The speakers show remarkable first dialect stability with respect to their low back vowel system, even after many years of new dialect exposure: in minimal pair contexts, nearly all of the speakers continue to produce and perceive a single vowel category. However, in word list and conversational contexts, the majority of speakers exhibit a small but significant phonetic difference between words like cot and caught, reflecting the separation of these word classes in the new dialect to which they are exposed; moreover, the realization of these words shows frequency effects consistent with a lexically gradual divergence of the two vowels. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of phonological representation and change, as well as their methodological implications for the study of mergers- and splits-in-progress.},

We show that his observation is not valid by presenting naturally occurring examples of the expressions which involve frequency adverbs and the progressive aspect, respectively. Further we investigate how the frequency adverbs are allowed and what functions the progressive aspect has. For the frequency adverbs we propose a licensing condition employing the sense of iteration. It also turns out that the subjective motion implicit in the expressions makes a major contribution to the occurrence of the adverbs in a certain case. As to the progressive aspect we take up two cases, namely, its use in captions and in discourses describing courses/routes of particular paths and point out that in the former it conveys the speaker's or writer's higher degree of subjective perspective and in the latter it can be used to add a further explanation to a particular phase of the path described. Lastly, we discuss briefly the aspectual property of the expressions and its relation to the occurrence of frequency adverbs and the progressive aspect.},

The difference is that while the Japanese imperfective marker does focus on the resultant stage by triggering the resultant state reading, the English imperfective marker does not have such a function. In English, the seeming result meaning arises only from the cause–effect connection between the state depicted by the imperfective sentence and the situation which brings about that state. The imperfective marker has nothing to do with that meaning. This leads to the conclusion that the English imperfective aspect can focus only on the preliminary reading and the internal reading.},

It functions as `a relative pronoun', `a complementizer', `a conjunction meaning when', and `a conjunction meaning because'. In addition to the above mentioned grammatical functions, it has a different functional behaviour. It can be used after any constituent in a sentence—NP, AdjP, PP, and VP—and it can also be used after subject, direct object, indirect object, verb, comparative adjective complement, subject complement, object complement, different adjuncts, negative adjunct, and non-verbal part of compound verb. In this functional role, `ke' is used in order to focalize the constituent and make it prominent. If it is deleted, the sentence remains grammatical and its propositional meaning doesn't change, while its information structure regarding prominence/focus alters. It is generally believed that in order for an element to be focalized, it is necessary to be preposed to the beginning of the sentence. This study shows that focalization occurs in situ; that is, in Persian, through the use of `ke' as a focus marker, elements can receive prominence in situ and any movement to the beginning of the sentence is just for topicalization.},

I claim that such splits are allowed by the inherent asymmetries of conjunctional structures, and I see them as functionally motivated by a play of prominence of the conjuncts involved. Three subtypes of such splits are distinguished: (i) splits by elision, where the conjuncts form a constituent but their phrasal contiguity is disrupted because the more salient conjunct is elided due to its topicality; (ii) splits by extraction, where the salient conjunct is given even more prominence by being extracted to a topical position thus breaking the continuity of the conjuncts; and (iii) splits by integration, where the role of the less salient conjunct is upgraded by means of dual or plural agreement on the verb.

    abstract = {This article introduces two new mathematical formulas designed to describe, compare, and contrast languages in terms of the overall markedness and complexity of their phonological rule components. The Transparency Index evaluates the four classical types of ordering relationships which obtain between individual pairs of rules, building on Kiparsky's (Linguistic universals and linguistic change, Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1968, Historical linguistics, University of Maryland Linguistics Program, 1971) classification of these as either feeding, bleeding, counterfeeding, or counterbleeding. Among these, feeding and bleeding orders are transparent in that they result in surface-true generalizations and are therefore natural and preferred, whereas counterbleeding and counterfeeding relationships lead to opaque (non-transparent) phonetic outcomes since the final surface representation appears to be a counterexample to one of the rules. For each language that we wish to analyze, the Transparency Index calculates the attested frequency of both types of transparent interactions grouped together (feeding and bleeding), and divides this sum by the total number of tokens of all four rule ordering types combined. The Density Index, on the other hand, computes the total number of crucial rule orderings (regardless of which kind) among each exhaustive, language-specific inventory of processes. These two statistical proposals are applied to a sample of seven genetically and areally diverse languages to illustrate their usefulness and rank each language along a continuum of relative typological markedness and simplicity. This study constitutes the first rigorous attempt to quantify the occurrence of different types of phonological rule relationships – including their degree of interaction and inherent rate of opacity – both within and across languages. It thus represents a step forward in extending an old line of inquiry into a topic which has recently spawned a renewed wave of interest, partly due to the problems it raises for standard Optimality Theory.},

When either of the coordinates is a personal pronoun, difficult choices have to be made about the form of the pronoun. These difficulties arise especially with the single genitive, which is judged to be totally ungrammatical in coordinations like *my wife and I's or *my wife and my. On the other hand, the alternative use of the multiple genitive, my wife's and my, conflicts with a preference for the single genitive when the coordinates are felt to constitute a single unit. In this article, we first conduct a corpus-based analysis for genitive coordinations with personal pronouns, based on the British National Corpus. This, supplemented by some non-standard examples from web-based sources, gives some insight into the choices actually made by native speakers. We then provide a theoretical account of the syntactic problems that genitive coordinations with pronouns create. This account is shown to be compatible solely with an analysis of the English 's genitive as an inflectional affix.},

Instead of this system, from Middle English onwards a mixed system emerges with differently structured bounded sentence constructions as well as, increasingly, unbounded sentence constructions – which structure events as open-ended, usually by means of a progressive form (e.g. he was walking). I show how weorðan in Old English was strongly associated with the Old English system of bounded sentence constructions – an association with boundedness is not surprising given its meaning of `(sudden) transition into another state'. In the thirteenth century this rigid Old English system started to break down, as primarily evidenced by the disappearance of the time adverbial þa and the loss of verb-second. Wearð, being strongly associated with the old way of structuring narrative, decreased too and eventually disappeared.},

    abstract = {Malaysian English (MalE) is widely used in Malaysia by different ethnic groups. From the perspective of ethnolects, MalE can be divided into the subvarieties of Malay-influenced (MME), Chinese-influenced (ChME) and Indian-influenced (IME) MalE. This paper places MalE within its geographical and linguistic context and then describes the consonantal features which are shared and not shared across MME, ChME and IME. The study involved 15 undergraduates, aged from 19 to 22 years old. There were five participants in each of the three ethnicities, Chinese, Malay and Indian. The participants read a list of words containing all the English consonant phonemes. The data were transcribed and analyzed descriptively. The results indicate that Malaysians maintain a combination of features in their pronunciation, some of which mark them out as distinctively `Malaysian', and others which reveal their ethnic origins as Chinese, Malay or Indian. One cannot therefore assume that all Malaysians sound alike when they speak English.},

The diachrony of this phenomenon explains two unusual features of the modern stage of Mundurukú: (i) a specific constraint where /d/ (from * L), but not other oral stops, is only followed by oral vowels, even in nasal harmony domains; and (ii) a dialect split where reflexes of * L in the context just referred to are /d/ in one dialect but /n/ in another. These two unusual features of Mundurukú are not shared by Kuruaya, which has a harmony system similar to that reconstructed for Proto-Mundurukú. The success of this study in illuminating language-specific aspects of Mundurukú nasal harmony supports more general approaches in which natural and unnatural sound patterns are explained in historical terms.},

Combining theoretical insights from the framework of grammaticalization with the empirical methods of variationist sociolinguistics, we operationalize key diagnostics of grammaticalization (syntagmatic length, decategorialization, semantic-pragmatic change) as independent factor groups in the quantitative analysis of GE variability. While multivariate analyses reveal rapid changes in apparent time to the social conditioning of some GE variants in our data, they do not reveal any evidence of systematic changes in the linguistic conditioning of variants in apparent time that would confirm an interpretation of ongoing grammaticalization. These results lead us to question Cheshire's (2007) recent hypothesis that GEs are grammaticalizing in contemporary varieties of British English. They additionally raise caveats with regard to the assumption that the linguistic conditioning of GE variability in contemporary data sets is the product of change.},

    abstract = {My contribution explores the potential of Standard Average European (SAE) as a methodological yardstick for the assessment of the Celticity of Standard English (SE), i.e. the degree to which SE may have been influenced by Insular Celtic languages. SAE allows a quantification of the extent to which SE differs from other SAE languages and at the same time shows similarities with Insular Celtic languages which are generally thought to deviate from SAE. The concept of SAE will be introduced and a complex test case will be analyzed: the rise of identical reflexives and intensifiers and the frequency of `labile' verbs, e.g. to break both intransitive and transitive, in English. Reflexives and intensifiers are identical in Insular Celtic, but separate categories in SAE. According to Haspelmath (1993), labile verbs are unusually frequent in English by SAE standards, and they are also very frequent in Insular Celtic. It will be shown that the frequency of labile verbs in SE and Insular Celtic results from the identity of reflexives and intensifiers in these languages. Since the frequency of labile verbs thus can be shown to be a typologically secondary phenomenon, it is the rise of the new system of identical reflexives and intensifiers in SE which is methodologically the relevant linguistic subsystem within the complex test case for which Insular Celtic influence can be proposed and which can be adduced as an argument in favor of the Celtic hypothesis. For the assessment of the Celtic hypothesis, it will therefore be rewarding to complement the initial comparison of SE and Insular Celtic with further data from SAE and general typology whenever the linguistic subsystems under scrutiny allows the inclusion of such data.},

This article brings the putative lack under examination, arguing that a more complete distributional analysis reveals a pattern: overlap is highest among semantically peripheral adjectives and verbs and in constructions prototypically associated to both classes crosslinguistically, and lowest among semantically core adjectives and verbs and in constructions prototypically associated to only one or the other class. Rather than “lacking” adjectives, data from Thai thus in fact support functional-typological characterizations of adjectival universality such as those of Givón (1984), Croft (2001), and Dixon (2004). Finally, while data from Thai would fail to falsify an adaptation of Enfield's (2004) Lao lexical class-taxonomy (in which adjectives are treated as a verbal subclass) on its own terms, this article argues that in absence of both universally-applicable criteria for the evaluation of categorial taxonomies crosslinguistically and evidence for the cognitive reality of categorial taxonomies so stipulated, even this more limited sense of a “lack” of adjectives in Thai is less radical a challenge to adjectival universality than has sometimes been supposed.},

A two-year-old Mam child growing up with intense pressure to use Spanish exhibited changes to verb, existential, and negation constructions that were not evident in the language of other Mayan-speaking children. Verb use and negation appear to be especially sensitive indicators of such change. Contact-induced structural change shows how children's emerging grammars accommodate new structural elements.

The analysis of the spontaneous narrative tends to confirm previous accounts of the information-structure patterns in Buglere, while the results of the experiments only partially confirm previous accounts.

Our results indicate that preposition copying creates redundancy rather than ungrammaticality, whereas preposition pruning creates processing problems for comprehenders that may render it unacceptable in timed (but not necessarily in untimed) judgement tasks.

Although the address term mate (as in How ya going mate?) is generally included in discussions of mate and mateship, very little analysis of how it is actually used in Australian English has been carried out. This preliminary study focuses on the vocative use of mate through a survey of 698 respondents in which they were asked whether they use mate when addressing other people, whether they are addressed by mate, who they predominantly address as mate and whether they like mate as a term of address. The results show that there seems to be a shift in terms of how mate, as an address term, is used and understood. Whereas mate has traditionally been understood as a male solidarity term used `by males and for males', this preliminary survey shows that more young women, aged between 18 and 29 years, are reporting their use of the address term mate compared to women aged over 50 years. The preliminary study seems to suggest that instead of mate being characterized as a neutral term used by men to show equality and egalitarianism, young women now see mate as a friendly and fun term that, along with many other address forms, is available to show intimacy.},

Although researchers are beginning to re-examine interactionally some of the previous observational claims concerning adult Aboriginal conversational style, less focus has been given to Indigenous children's interactional style. Previous observational claims concerning Aboriginal conversational style include increased toleration of silence, increased occurrence of interruptions, reluctance to respond to questions, and the tendency to enter a conversation without attending to the talk of others. One of the aims of the paper is to examine instances of children's interaction against the backdrop of these observations concerning Aboriginal adult conversation style in order to understand how Indigenous children interact with others within the multilingual environment in which they find themselves. Using the methodology of conversation analysis, the paper analyses the talk of two children from Yakanarra in order to show (a) how the children under analysis responded to a request to do something, and the sorts of techniques used to mobilize such a response; and (b) how the children monitored the surrounding adults' talk occurring within the same interactional space. The analysis, presented against the backdrop of what has been observed to date concerning adult Indigenous conversational style, demonstrates the importance of examining the detail of talk, taking all aspects into account (including prosody, pauses, overlap), in order to understand how two Indigenous children living in Yakanarra interact within their social and cultural worlds.},

The nouns involved are limited to body parts in Navajo, to kinship terms in Chiricahua Apache, and to skin ailments or substances typically clinging to the body in Western Apache. These differences suggest that diachronically the patterns arose independently from one another. The most interesting pattern is that of Western Apache (it also might exist in embryonic fashion in Navajo and Chiricahua Apache) and is due to the grammaticalization of a proclitic and enclitic complex around a noun. This complex was then reinterpreted as adjectival verb morphology, and the resulting word can be inflected as an adjectival verb.},

In a survey of 44 genetically and areally diverse languages, we have tracked synchronic usage patterns for 54 allative markers and confirmed that they indeed exhibit a wide range of semantic and grammatical functions. A number of previous grammaticalization studies undertaken from a cognitive/typological perspective have argued that various non-spatial goal-marking senses of allative morphemes, such as dative/benefactive and purposive, often develop out of a spatial sense through various semantic extensions. Our data also indicated that allatives grammaticalize extensively, but that dative, purposive, and other common abstract extensions, perhaps strongly associated with the allative sense, have an equal – and thus independent – likelihood of developing. That is, their functional evolution is not fully predetermined by a single implicational hierarchy or by a unidimensional grammaticalization chain. Instead, an allative marker undergoing grammaticalization has multiple extension pathways available to it.},

    abstract = {Since Greenberg's groundbreaking publication on universals of grammar, typologists have used semantic categories to investigate (constraints on) morphological and syntactic variation in the world's languages and this tradition has been continued in the WALS project. It is argued here that the employment of semantic categories has some serious drawbacks, however, suggesting that semantic categories, just like formal categories, cannot be equated across languages in morphosyntactic typology. Whereas formal categories are too narrow in that they do not cover all structural variants attested across languages, semantic categories can be too wide, including too many structural variants. Furthermore, it appears that in some major typological studies semantic categories have been confused with formal categories. A possible solution is pointed out: typologists first need to make sure that the forms or constructions under investigation do the same job in the various languages (functional sameness); subsequently this functional selection can be narrowed down on the basis of formal or semantic criteria to construct a set of elements that is similar enough to allow for crosslinguistic comparison (formal and semantic similarity).},

In Middle English the `preferential' senses of rather (e.g. the type `I would rather do X than Y') become more common than the temporal senses. This contrastive meaning constitutes the unmarked use of rather in Early Modern English, but it gradually weakens in the course of the Modern English period. The moderator use becomes popular in the second half of the eighteenth century. The semantic development outlined above goes hand in hand with a syntactic development from an original adjunct into a subjunct and conjunct, and finally into a modifier of adjectives and adverbs.},

This paper analyses the uses of this clitic and its interactions with tenses at clause level, as well as its role in the wider discourse context. We argue that -rru has temporal and contrastive properties, more specifically that -rru modifies the time of the eventuality denoted and signals a change: it introduces a contrast with an earlier state of affairs corresponding to the negation of the eventuality denoted. Thus temporal progression is also inferred. We propose to represent this contrast as a presupposition that -rru introduces, using Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). We also show that in discourse, -rru is used to introduce new subtopics, thus expressing contrasts at this wider level as well. Discourse relations and their temporal inferences are analysed using Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT). We conclude that, while -rru often corresponds to the adverb `then' in English, its contrastive properties liken it more to the adverb `now' in other languages, especially when the latter is used in non-present time contexts.},

This article examines the retention of inflection in 29 languages that reflect a history of pidginization in their development, comparing the morphological richness of pidgins with their respective lexifiers. The results indicate an asymmetry between the retention of inherent and contextual inflections, such that pidgins express fewer grammatical categories via contextual inflection than do their lexifiers.

The original negator was reanalyzed as an optional negative polarity item in indicative clauses without losing its independent negative feature in non-indicative contexts. The reanalysis started with unrelated changes that led first to the disappearance of a small class of clitic particles attaching onto the negator. These particles acted as negative force intensifiers or inter-sentential linkers and were widespread in Classical K'iche' texts.

There are five markers for third person, specified for humanness, number, gender, and speaker's gender. Interestingly, these markers compete with another marker for third person, the prefix ty-, which is semantically unspecified. The most important factor in the distribution of the two alternatives for third-person A/S marking is transitivity. The transitivity of a construction cannot be determined just by the valence of the root (the number of participants) but depends also on other parameters such as the semantic characteristics of the participants and the discourse function of the utterance. As a consequence, transitivity must be seen as a continuum rather than a dichotomy. Since most roots are ambitransitive, transitivity is a category of the utterance level rather than the lexical level. This fluid transitivity is an essential characteristic of Mojeño Trinitario.},

Several seminal arguments for new and high-profile phonological theories are now based at least in part upon analyses of Hale's data set. After reviewing what is of such interest in Lardil, a body of data is assembled which alters our understanding of the empirical facts and theoretical implications of Lardil phonology. Hale's process of Laminalization is reanalyzed as Apicalization; constrained lexical exceptions are found with respect to Apocope, Apicalization and Truncation; and a process of Raising is identified. A discussion of the systematicity of these new data, and of their demonstrable antiquity leads to the conclusion that future formal analyses of the language must account not only for already well-known properties of the data, but for the existence of multiple, active patterns that apply selectively throughout the lexicon.},

Within the framework of an enriched version of relevance theory, the paper illustrates how linguistic (im)politeness can be investigated by incorporating the notions of self-politeness and higher-order intentions in the metarepresentation of speaker meaning. Focusing on compliment responses that are problematic for the maxim and the face-management approaches to politeness, the paper argues that evaluations of (im)politeness emerge via higher-level explicatures as a metarepresentation of the higher-level intention of the addressee. The paper thereby aims to contribute toward the integration of the cognitive and the social perspectives in (im)politeness research.},

    abstract = {This paper discusses the argument-coding system of Mosetenan, a small language family spoken in the Bolivian Amazon. While there is no case marking on nouns, all coding of arguments is found in the cross-reference ending of verbs. Intransitive verbs are marked for the gender of their subjects, except for the first-person plural inclusive, which has a marker, -ja', that does not indicate the gender of the subject. Transitive cross-referencing is more complicated. It is a layered system that combines the grammatical relation of the participant (S, A, or O) with the person (1, 2, 3) and number (singular and plural). Again, the forms of first-person plural inclusive subjects are unique. The second most important forms are third-person objects, which appear before any of the speech-act participants (SAP). I analyze the Mosetenan system, discussing how language contact can shape the general outline of an argument-coding system by the introduction of a new category such as an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first-person plural.},

Specifically, whereas TH-fronting is sensitive to phonotactic context and prosodic position in Edinburgh, we observe no such effects amongst the London speakers. Morphological complexity, on the other hand, is a significant predictor of TH-fronting in both regions; however, we also find evidence of significant gender differences in the use of fronting in London that do not emerge in our Edinburgh data. We argue that these results attest to the more established nature of TH-fronting in London as compared to Edinburgh. We also address the question of how speech perception influences the emergence and spread of innovative neutralisation phenomena like TH-fronting. The results of this study further highlight the usefulness of a comparative variationist approach to understanding patterns of dialectal variation and change.},

In this article I argue that (1) the way in which the West Germanic sound system was reshaped in Old English strongly suggests the operation of a hitherto unrecognized substratum; (2) that phonetic substratum is strongly reminiscent of Irish rather than British Celtic; (3) the Old Irish phonetic-phonological system provides a more plausible model for reconstructing the phonetics of pre-Roman Celtic in Britain than the British Celtic system. The conclusion is that there is phonetic continuity between pre-Roman British Celtic and Old English, which suggests the presence of a pre-Anglo-Saxon population shifting to Old English.},

At first sight, this looks like construction conveying grammatical aspect, specifically progressive, since it bears both formal and functional resemblances to typical progressive constructions. At closer investigation, however, the two morphemes crucially involved in the construction, a grammatical morpheme = mayan and a `semantically light' inflecting verb, in their combination can be shown to convey lexical rather than grammatical aspect:=mayan, which occurs in a wider range of contexts, can be analysed as a marker of iterativity, and the inflecting verbs -yu `be' and -ijga `go' signal atelicity of different flavours, and are selected as classificatory verbs in analogy to other closed-class verbs in complex predicates in Jaminjung. The findings support a distinction made in the literature between event-internal and event-external pluractionality. Of all pluractionals, only event-internal iterative expressions (which include not only complex predicates but also iterated direct speech) are overtly marked as atelic in Jaminjung, and only those exhibit the functional overlap with a progressive. The study of this construction thus provides an insight into the pathway of grammaticalization between lexical and grammatical aspect.},

In doing so, this paper also treats some general grammatical characteristics of the language, such as tone and argument marking. The Resı́garo causative marker is used to increase the valency of both intransitive and transitive verbs. The causative objects of causativized verbs are the only syntactically obligatory objects in the language. The second, more minor aim of this paper is a brief comparison of the Resı́garo causative marker with cognate forms in the related Arawakan languages Achagua, Piapoco, and Tariana. This reveals syntactic and semantic parallels that point to a close association of causativization and transitivity in this group of languages.

Examination of data from surrounding languages shows that the systems in the two main branches are as similar to those of neighboring languages as they are to each other. This suggests that areal diffusion of nominal classification probably took place at an early stage in the history of Witotoan languages.},

Corpus data presented here will also serve to address issues pertaining to the nature of the determinants of grammatical variation, such as their independent versus epiphenomenal character, their interactions, and the locus of their effects on word order.},

Noun-verb idioms are likely to be universal but there are two related types of idioms which are not. In the first, referred to as idiomatic noun-incorporation, the argument-like element is a noun which is incorporated into a verb. An example is the Bininj Gun-wok expression -dalk-ngun die, which combines the verb -ngun eat with the noun -dalk- grass. In the second, the argument-like element is a bound pronominal in the verb with fixed gender features. An example is the Mawng verb -marrajpu walk, which always has Land gender object agreement, although no corresponding participant can be identified. The latter type is referred to as lexicalised agreement verbs and described in some detail. It is argued that the three types of constructions, referred to as verb-argument idioms, form a valid crosslinguistic category about which typological generalisations can be made.

    abstract = {Following work by Bloomfield (1946; 1958), the primary verb stem in Algonquian is traditionally described in terms of a template of three elements: initial, medial, and final. However, both Bloomfield himself and the subsequent scholarship (e.g., Rhodes 1976, Goddard 1988; 1990, and O'Meara 1990) have also recognized that the structure of the stem is more complex than the simple template might suggest. In this paper, I build on these insights, taking them one step further. Drawing on Oji-Cree, I propose a distinction between two types of stems, based on the complexity of their internal structure. A simple stem is formed by combining a root and a verbal head, while a Complex Stem involves an intermediate constituent that is salient at the phonological and syntactic level. I adduce phonological and syntactic evidence for the distinction between the two stem types and then focus on the properties of complex stems, arguing that they are subject to predictable syntactic restrictions. The analysis developed in this paper helps situate the Algonquian stem within a broader syntactic theory as well as accounts for a number of puzzling facts about the verb stem. The analysis also provides support for the view (Brittain 2003, Hirose 2003, Piggott and Newell 2006, and Mathieu 2008) that a significant portion of word formation in Algonquian takes place in syntax.},

Navajo has linguistic forms that give temporal information: future tense, past and future particles, and temporal adverbials. These forms are optional, so that many sentences contain no direct temporal information. In such cases, aspectual information gives pragmatic cues to the temporal location of the situation expressed. The key factor is boundedness: in the default case, unbounded situations are taken as present and bounded situations as past. Three pragmatic principles explain the inference from aspect to temporal location. The principles, which also hold for certain other languages, apply to verb words with overt aspectual viewpoints as well as to zero-marked verb words.},

    abstract = {This article presents a novel approach to the phenomenon of intrusive-r in English based on analogy. The main claim of the article is that intrusive-r in non-rhotic dialects of English is the result of the analogical extension of the r~zero alternation shown by words such as far, more and dear. While this idea has been around for a long time, this is the first study that explores this type of analysis in detail. Specifically, I provide an overview of the developments that led to the emergence of intrusive-r and show that they are fully compatible with an analogical approach. This includes the analysis of frequency data taken from an eighteenth-century corpus of English compiled specifically for the purposes of this article and the discussion of a related development, namely intrusive-l. The article also presents a review of the evidence about the variability of intrusive-r, which serves as the basis of an evaluation of previous approaches. Once the notion of analogy is made formally explicit, the analogical approach becomes capable of providing a unified account of the historical development and the variability of intrusive-r. This is demonstrated through a computer simulation of the emergence of the phenomenon based on the eighteenth-century corpus mentioned above. The results of the simulation confirm the predictions of the analogical approach.},

It situates duplication (one of the phonological expressions of syntactic number) and subtraction (one of the phonological expressions of aspect) within this treatment. Morphological analysis might be easier if there were a one-to-one relationship between grammatical notion and phonological expression—if, for example, `plural' number in Language-L were always and only associated with the presence of the morph Z. Whether the investigation begins with `plural' or with Z, it would cover the same ground. However, the properties of Tohono 'O'odham morphology, where duplication is only one of the expressions of syntactic number and subtraction only one of the expressions of aspect, are relatively common. This paper argues, therefore, that the grammatical notion, not the phonological expression, provides the appropriate starting point for morphological analysis.},

It is suggested that the system of pronominal gender assignment went through a process of semantically based reorganization during this period, and that the resulting patterns are most usefully described using the model of a hierarchy or continuum of individuation (Dahl 1999a: 99; Siemund 2008: 140). The gender assignment of individual nouns is found to be remarkably regular, and the material seems to give no reason to assume a period of confusion between the Old and postmedieval English systems of gender assignment.},

Roots in these languages are lexically marked for the suprasegmental features of nasalization and tone, features I describe, analyze, and contrast with what I propose to be a third suprasegmental feature of roots: glottalization. The glottal stops that occur regularly in a subset of roots have been alternately analyzed in the ET literature as a secondary feature of vowels, as a full consonant segment, or as an articulatory phenomenon linked to tone. I review these analyses and contrast them with a presentation of glottalization as a third, independent suprasegmental feature of roots. I argue that the suprasegmental approach is applicable to a wider range of data and therefore demonstrates clear explanatory advantages over previous analyses.},

    abstract = {Kala Lagaw Ya is the language of the Western Torres Strait islands, with two main dialects centred around Saibai Island and Mabuiag Island. It exhibits complex tense/aspect marking involving both temporal remoteness distinctions (`metrical tense') and aspectual distinctions. This article investigates the discourse-semantics of tense/aspect marking in a small corpus of oral traditional narratives from the Mabuiag dialect. Unsurprisingly, the resources of the `metrical tense system' are not fully exploited in the narrative texts, which exhibit a restricted range of `narrative' past tense marking including the Remote Past Perfective, a Remote Past Imperfective and a Present (or Non-Future) tense. The focus of the article is on patterns of distribution and shift between the Remote Past Perfective and the Present tense. Both these tenses are used extensively with `Narration' function: to mark sequences of events on the narrative timeline. In some stories the Remote Past Perfective functions as the default framing tense, with the Present tending to be used in the middle of the story, and in particular in subjectively evaluated narrative `highpoints'. However stories are also found which are told predominantly in the Present tense. Patterns of consistent clustering vs. rapid alternations of the two tenses are also discussed and compared with the episodic and expressive structure of the stories. The article illustrates the usefulness of considering discourse data in understanding the meanings and functions of forms within an inflectional paradigm of this kind, and contributes to the range of language types for which tense/aspect shifting has been investigated.},

Based on a quantitative analysis, I present a way of viewing text organization in terms of these rhetorical subgroupings within a text that is determined by clause complex boundary and text span size. The corpus used in this study comprises six undergraduate essays that were analysed using RST. In my corpus, other than rhetorical relations that occur within clause complexes and those that occur at the macro level of organization, there are three levels of rhetorical subgroupings of text spans, with identifiable subsets of rhetorical relations. These subgroupings provide a way of conceptualizing mid-level organization within a text, that is the rhetorical `chunking' of different text span sizes within a large text.},

In fact, recent research on syntactic dialectology in early English (Kroch & Taylor 1997; Ogura 1999; Hogg 2004, 2006a; Ingham 2006) shows that linguistic variation has been present in the English language from the earliest times. This study reassesses the existence of variation in the syntax of texts belonging to different dialectal varieties in Old English, in particular in relative constructions. Based on an analysis of relative clauses in three versions of the Gospels from late Old English, representing West Saxon, Northumbrian and Mercian dialects, we will observe differences in the texts, regarding both the paradigm of relativizers and the position adopted by the relative clause within the main clause. I relate these differences to the existence of linguistic differences in northern and southern dialects.},

In particular, variability in F2 is limited, suggesting that the vowel is truly central and cannot be considered a back vowel phonologically. The present results are compared with results presented in Tabain & Perrier from three French speakers producing the high back rounded vowel /u/. The differences in articulatory strategies and in acoustic variability are discussed with respect to the vowel inventory of each language.

Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that other intensifiers are on the rise – so and pretty. Testing a series of contextual factors known to operate in the development of intensifiers (e.g. adjective function and type) as well as their intersection with social factors (e.g. age and sex) reveals evidence of ongoing delexicalization, but not as part of a continual longitudinal process. Instead, the profile of change reveals recycling, suggesting that the mechanisms of intensifier renewal may be more complex than previously thought.},

Occurring predominantly in informal registers, the conjunction is typically used to introduce information which the speaker takes to be self-evidently true and on whose basis some further comment, or query, is made. Drawing on data derived from internet searches we draw up a semantic profile of the expression in comparison and contrast with other reason connectives, namely, seeing (that) and since. The data suggest that seeing as though is associated with highly subjective construals of the reason relation. We also address the internal structure of the expression. The use of seeing in a reason conjunction is traced to a common conceptual metaphor, whereby knowing is seeing. More puzzling is the occurrence of as though. While rejecting the possibility of a compositional analysis of the expression, we note that as though is only one of a number of items which can occur with causal seeing. These items have to do with the appearance of things and are in fact able to occur as complementizers after predicates of seeming and appearing. To this extent, as though is consistent with the subjectivity associated with the complex conjunction. In the course of our investigation, we also document the extraordinary proliferation of reason connectives that involve lexical items such as seeing, as, though, and several others, and suggest that this exuberance of new forms may not be unrelated to the subjectivity inherent in the construal of causal relations.},

This article places the developing European interest in English much earlier than that, and it does so by analysing a series of letters in the library of the University of Leiden written by Englishmen from the Late Modern English period to men of letters in the Netherlands. The letters show that English as a medium of communication was not as a rule an issue, even though Dutch letter writers were rarely exposed to English and often lacked the tools – or the teachers – to acquire the language, a situation which would change drastically during the nineteenth century. The article also analyses the earliest attempts at writing in English by Johannes Stinstra, the Dutch translator of Samuel Richardson's Clarissa.},

This construction encodes a resultative semantics through two verbs, where the first verb causes the change of state denoted by the second verb. It resembles serial verbs, because the result is a verb and not a stative word. I propose a complex predicate analysis of this resultative; it has the morphosyntax and structure of simple clauses, the verbs map into a single cause–change-of-state event (where the first verb denotes the cause and manner and the second verb the change of state), and the argument structure involves argument fusion. It follows transitivity and lexical-semantic restrictions; the first verb is transitive and denotes a process and the second verb is a lexical intransitive and denotes a change of state. I argue that the lexical-semantic restrictions are predictable from event structure and the transitivity restrictions from the argument realization.},

I propose that the SPC has the syntax of a complex clause; the finite light verb is the matrix verb (which can be elided), the primary predicate is a nonfinite complement of the light verb (and a semantic main verb), and the secondary predicate left-adjoins to the light verb. Regarding the meaning, the depictive and end-state distinction is semantic and not structural; the end-state forms a semantic complex predicate as evidenced in its argument and event structures, but depictives may involve a process of linking.

This paper puts forward a model for corpus compilation in bilingual communities, illustrated through the New Mexican Spanish–English Bilingual corpus, in which the same speakers—from a long-standing minority community in the United States—use both Spanish and English in the same conversations, smoothly alternating between their languages. We advocate community-based fieldwork for the collection of speech data by community members; the formation of a corpus which comprises recordings of spontaneous interactions and is thus of widespread usability (rather than being tied to any particular set of research questions or elicited linguistic features); scrupulously compiling information about the demography and the linguistic history of the participants that may shape their patterns of language use; and comprehensive transcription of the data taking into account prosodic aspects and making considered decisions about how to responsibly represent the speech. This community-based approach yields linguistic data situated in its social context and amenable to systematic quantitative analysis, which allows for confronting the many claims about language contact with the facts of bilingual usage.},

These applicative types are rather common cross-linguistically and hence the language cannot be said to be particularly rich either in terms of number or kinds of applicative constructions. Nevertheless, the Shipibo-Konibo system exhibits certain points of special interest such as the interplay between transitivity and the different applicative construction types, which include a restriction on the dedicated malefactive to combine with transitive verbs only, and the almost exclusively benefactive semantics of the affective when attached to transitives. Also noteworthy are the high degree of symmetry with regard to the morphosyntactic properties of base and applicative objects, obligatoriness/optionality of applicative constructions, and the semantic requirements of certain arguments.},

This system is predominantly nominative–accusative, with the caveat that main clause object markers coincide with those conveying subject in one type of clause involving nominal predicates, as well as subject and object of dependent clauses. Second, this article provides a first analysis of the enclitic =ler, which may attach to transitive subjects and thus exhibits an ergative-like distribution. Unlike the situation in languages with syntacticized ergative systems, omission of =ler does not yield ungrammatical utterances; however, transitive clauses displaying a =ler-marked subject NP are not unusual either. It is argued that =ler has discriminatory and discourse-pragmatic functions, and is comparable to instances of “optional” or pragmatic marking of the ergative/agentive in other languages.},

This article discusses evidence gathered mainly from the York–Toronto–Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Prose, showing that it is a phenomenon that needs to be taken seriously in descriptions and analyses of Old English. It is argued that the factor shared by the two constructions is the lack of an available finite verb for ne to attach to. It is also found that the use of ne for the purpose of negative concord appears to be more variable with infinitives than it is with finite verbs. Whether attachment of ne to a non-finite verb in the absence of a finite one is restricted to bare infinitives is difficult to determine because of the limited evidence relating to other non-finite forms, but there are some indications that use of ne may have been possible with present participles. Finally, some implications that the ne + infinitive pattern has for the formal analysis of Old English are discussed.},

CTMPs are generally believed to depend on their prototypical simple present form in order to convey an epistemic/evidential meaning. Corpus evidence shows, however, that there exist several variant forms that equally function as interpersonal modifications. Such variation has long presented a stumbling block to studies approaching CTMPs from the point of view of grammaticalization theory, since this framework has traditionally been rather inimical to the idea that a grammaticalized item may encompass a paradigm of variant forms and instead requires internal fixation into an unalterable form. It will be argued that CTMPs should be regarded as constructions constituting a taxonomy characterized by several levels of schematicity. It will be demonstrated that the most frequently used CTMP, i think, has reached the highest degree of entrenchment and schematicity, and consequently sanctions the widest range of variant forms, which are disseminated throughout the taxonomy by virtue of analogization.},

It shows that the to-infinitive encroaches on the that-clause from Early Middle English onwards and comes to predominate in Late Middle English. It thus adduces evidence for Los's (2005) account of the rise of the to-infinitive as verbal complement: against the generally held view that the to-infinitive replaced the bare infinitive, Los (2005) shows that it spread at the expense of the subjunctive that-clause in Middle English, e.g. after intention verbs and manipulative verbs. After considering various factors such as the distribution of the to-infinitive in the adjectival complementation system, the tense of the matrix of the adjectival constructions and the Anglo-Saxon versus Romance origin of the adjectives, I conclude that the rise of the to-infinitive with adjectival matrices in Middle English has to be explained by analogy between verbal and adjectival mandative constructions. In addition, this study shows that – unlike with the verbal constructions – the to-infinitive with adjectival matrices stabilizes at roughly a 3:1 ratio to the that-clause from Early Modern English onwards. For these later periods, finally, it is proposed that the clausal variation may be motivated by lexical determination, discourse factors such as information structure, and stylistic preferences.},

This correlation is independent of the frequency of the adjective, and the uneven article distribution becomes even more skewed when an overt indicator of subjectivity, such as very or much, is introduced to the NP. I explain this tendency in terms of accessibility: subjective modifiers provide the speaker with a way of expressing a personal evaluation of the referent, and this evaluation is typically new information in discourse. Consequently, subjective premodifiers strongly favour indefinite NPs. By contrast, objective modifiers often encode information that is typical of the referent or else accessible from context or through world knowledge. Because the information expressed by the modifier is accessible, the accessibility of the discourse referent itself determines article choice, and the distribution of articles is more even. I also show that the connection between subjectivity and indefiniteness may provide the linguist with a useful tool in semantic disambiguation and diachronic research. Case studies of two polysemous -ing participles, moving and glowing, show that when used as a nominal premodifier, the subjective sense of the word (e.g. moving, `emotionally touching') strongly favours indefinite NPs over definite NPs. We will also see that when a participle (outstanding) or a noun (key) develops a subjective sense and undergoes category change to adjective, the new sense is particularly often used in indefinite constructions, and the semantic change and gradual adjectivisation of the word is mirrored in the gradual increase in the use of indefinite NPs.},

    abstract = {Compared to German Ja and Nein, English Yes and No are used less frequently, and often in combination with short sentences consisting of a pronoun and an auxiliary or modal verb: Yes I will; No I won't. When such a short sentence is used, Yes and No may be omitted: I will; I won't; I do; I don't; He can; They certainly won't. This difference in usage is established (1) by comparing the marriage vow in German and English, where the officiant's question is answered by Ja in German but by I will or I do in English; (2) by citing material from a practical grammar for German students of English; and (3) by studying the way Shakespeare has his figures answer decision questions, or Yes/No-questions, in comparison with Schlegel's way of rendering their answers in his German translation. Next it is shown that Shakespeare's way, which is essentially the same as modern usage, differs radically from earlier English usage up to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (1388--1400) and Troilus and Cresseide (1382--6) and the anonymous York Plays (fourteenth century) and Towneley Plays (late fourteenth century), which all reflect the Germanic usage, essentially the same as in German. It is concluded that the modern English usage arose during the two centuries between Chaucer and Shakespeare, as a Late Middle English and Early Modern English innovation. As for the reason why English developed this un-Germanic way of answering decision questions, reference is made to Insular Celtic: decision questions are answered with short sentences in both Irish and Welsh, and this usage is old in both languages. The viability of this contact explanation is underlined by Irish English, where Yes and No are used even less frequently than in Modern Standard English, and short sentences are the normal way of answering decision questions.},

The paper first surveys the different mechanisms available for marking a shift from the narrator's deictic centre to a narrative participant, including a number of constructions that use perception and motion predicates to signal RST. The analysis then focuses on the narrative functions of RST, showing that it has a macrostructural function beyond the representation of a specific participant's speech and thought, more specifically highlighting the central episodes of a narrative. The evidence comes from an analysis of three genres with a different macrostructure: one (personal history) for which the classic Labovian schema of complication–resolution works well and two others (both dealing with the supernatural world) that rely on different structuring principles. It is shown that RST is systematically associated with central episodes across the three genres, and that the location and nature of RST co-vary with the different location and nature of these episodes in the three genres. In narratives of supernatural encounter, for instance, RST conveys modal negotiation about the interpretation of the central events in terms of the supernatural world.},

    abstract = {It is commonly held that Old English hwæt, well known within Anglo-Saxon studies as the first word of the epic poem Beowulf, can be `used as an adv[erb]. or interj[ection]. Why, what! ah!' (Bosworth & Toller 1898, s.v. hwæt, 1) as well as the neuter singular of the interrogative pronoun hwā `what'. In this article I challenge the view that hwæt can have the status of an interjection (i.e. be outside the clause that it precedes). I present evidence from Old English and Old Saxon constituent order which suggests that hwæt is unlikely to be extra-clausal. Data is drawn from the Old English Bede, Ælfric's Lives of Saints and the Old Saxon Heliand. In all three texts the verb appears later in clauses preceded by hwæt than is normal in root clauses (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.0001 in both cases). If hwæt affects the constituent order of the clause it precedes, then it cannot be truly clause-external. I argue that it is hwæt combined with the clause that follows it that delivers the interpretive effect of exclamation, not hwæt alone. The structure of hwæt-clauses is sketched following Rett's (2008) analysis of exclamatives. I conclude that Old English hwæt (as well as its Old Saxon cognate) was not an interjection but an underspecified wh-pronoun introducing an exclamative clause.},

I argue that changes in the availability of negative inversion reflect changes in the way sentential scope for negation is marked in negative concord constructions. Thus, negative concord involving Middle and Early Modern English not does not co-occur with negative inversion, but negative concord involving Middle English ne does. Changes to negative inversion can be seen to parallel changes in the way sentential scope negation is expressed at successive stages of the Middle English Jespersen Cycle. I propose that the changes to negative inversion and Jespersen's Cycle should both be analysed as changes in the ability of negative items to mark sentential scope for negation. This observation can be formalised within a Minimalist framework as variation in the LF-interpretability of negative features, following the account of Jespersen's Cycle proposed by Wallage (2008).},

Although speakers across England's north-west have a nurse~square merger, its realisation differs: in Liverpool, speakers typically merge to a mid front [ɛː], while speakers from St Helens, just 20km further east, merge to a mid central [ɜː]. To test listeners' responses to each variant, we presented two groups of listeners from each of these localities with read sentence data from a single speaker. The speaker was from the north-west of England and had a centralised nurse~square vowel in his native accent (representing the St Helens model). To achieve a matched-guise, the original nurse~square vowels were acoustically manipulated to give the impression of fronting (representing the Liverpool model). Listeners from Liverpool and St Helens were asked to react to guises along the status dimension, and their reaction was measured in real-time using bespoke audience response software administered via the web. The novelty in this approach is that it can be used not only to show that listeners do indeed react to the guises, but also to examine precisely when this reaction takes place. Our results show that (a) overall, speakers with a nurse~square merger are not rated highly on the status dimension, regardless of whether they have a merger to a front or central vowel; (b) listeners' real-time reactions can be correlated with instances of nurse and square; and (c) listeners' responses to nurse can be different from responses to square. We discuss these results in relation to the salience of this merger in particular and to salience in general. We suggest that the salience of nurse and square is related to the local social context and the micro-linguistic context in which they appear.},

    abstract = {Two main hypotheses have been proposed to account for the word order of negative inversion (NI) in varieties of non-canonical English (e.g. Don't nobody else care). An auxiliary inversion analysis argues that the word order is derived via movement of the auxiliary to the left periphery, whereas an existential analysis argues that the word order is an artifact of deletion of the expletive subject, paralleling there-insertion existential constructions. After reviewing these hypotheses, I provide empirical evidence that neither of these theories adequately explains the peculiarities of NI. I advance a third hypothesis, namely that NI is the result of negative movement to the specifier of NegP, and that this movement is pragmatically motivated by an existential meaning in NI constructions. Syntactically, NI is made possible through the Neg-Criterion (Haegeman & Zanuttini 1991, 1996). This analysis explains problems encountered by prior analyses, and offers a unified analysis for variation in NI across dialects. Finally, I explain cross-dialectal differences in NI by considering the relationship between subject requirements and agreement.},

    abstract = {English permits adverbial subordinate clauses to be placed either before or after their associated main clause. Previous research has shown that the positioning is conditioned by various factors from the domains of semantics, discourse pragmatics and language processing. With the exception of Diessel (2008), these factors have never been investigated in concert, which makes it difficult to understand their relative importance. Diessel's study, however, discusses only temporal constructions and identifies iconicity of sequence as the strongest predictor of clause position. Since this explanation is, in principle, unavailable for other types of subordinate clauses, the generalizability of Diessel's findings is somewhat limited. The present study offers a multifactorial analysis of 2,000 concessive constructions from the written part of the BNC and assesses the variable importance of six factors for the ordering choice, showing that semantic and discourse-pragmatic factors are much stronger predictors of clause position than processing-based, weight-related ones. On a methodological note, the study proposes that random forests using conditional inference trees constitute the preferred tool for the general type of problem investigated here.},

What literature there is tends to be either anecdotal or based on media language or on findings from experimental, subjective reaction tests where samples of speech are matched against those produced by speakers of other varieties of English. This study aims to add to existing research through an examination of responses of Australian adolescents to the following question: `When you think about “Australian English”, tell me the first three things that come into your mind'. The findings fall into three broad overlapping categories: (i) comments about language features; (ii) comments about attitudes towards those features; and (iii) comments about culture. All three categories contain responses which suggest that young Australians associate Australian English with rural and informal lifestyles. Those who provide attitudinal judgments either describe the variety in neutral terms or give it evaluations typical of those reported for broad and vernacular varieties of English. Of particular interest is the frequency with which categories overlap and intersect, and the mythscapes they construct of Australian language and identity.},

    abstract = {This paper deals with the politics of language, power and pedagogy in Ethiopia, with a focus on the past and present conditions of the Oromo language. The paper evaluates the major historico-political factors that constrained the linguistic human rights of the Oromo during Haile Sellassie's and Mengistu's Ethiopia, and reflects on the status of the Oromo language and the divergent myths and practices that have continued to plague the use of the Oromo language for education and development in post-Mengistu Ethiopia. The thesis of the paper is that in Ethiopia, where the nation building agenda in the past was premised largely on the Amharization of the empire, the homogenizing agents imposed the superiority of Amharic over other languages in the country. Drawing on critical multiculturalism, resistant postmodernism and cultural capital, the paper tries to address the inherent meaning of the politics of language, power and pedagogy in Ethiopia. The paper concludes that the current attempt to revitalize the Oromo language should be well informed that the forces of history continue to limit the implementability of the seemingly egalitarian linguistic and cultural policy unless they are struggled against. If the language policy is not matched with practical work on the ground, the romanticized linguistic rights stipulated in the policy may remain only the language of legitimation for political ends.},

    abstract = {This paper addresses two verbal affixes in Kari'nja, the ky- prefix and the -ng suffix, and the constructions in which they appear. -ng appears in several constructions, while ky- appears only in what is called here “the ky- construction.'' Hoff (1986) assigned the two affixes to a greater interacting system of evidentiality in the language that includes these two morphemes as well as a closed class of 17 evidential particles. The present account posits that ky- was, historically, a marker of remote deixis and -ng an indicator of “uncertainty” modality. However, in the ky- construction, those etymological semantic values have been bleached and the ky- construction has become conventionalized as the unmarked way of referring to non-Speech-Act Participant events in all but recent past tense. This analysis better reflects speaker insights, is more consistent with analyses of cognate morphemes of other languages in the family, and gives adult learners a more concrete description, aiding acquisition of this form.},

    abstract = {Focus subtypes can be characterized according to scope and pragmatic (e.g., [non]-contrastive) information. While the existence of strategies dedicated to code scope seems clear, the existence of grammar dedicated to pragmatic contrast is in dispute (Lambrecht 1994 and Myhill and Xing 1996). Some models propose that contrast is expressed in sentence grammar (Dik et al. 1981 and Watters 1979); others argue that contrast belongs to conversational implicature (Lambrecht 1994). Kokama-Kokamilla, an Amazonian language, has constructions that clearly distinguish focus subtypes according to both parameters. More specifically, this study examines the distribution of the clitic =pura. While this morpheme is an important cue to identifying pragmatically marked sentences, by itself it cannot be associated with specific subtypes of focus. It is the interaction of =pura with constituent order and prosody that produces formal distinctions for coding narrow vs. broad and contrastive vs. noncontrastive focus.},

    abstract = {Buchan Scots exhibits a unique phonological process in which mid vowels undergo raising that is triggered by both voiced consonants and stressed high vowels. The fact that the triggers of assimilation do not fall neatly into a single natural class under most feature theories makes it an interesting challenge to straightforward analysis. Given the phonological patterns and a variety of phonetic facts about Buchan, I propose a [Lowered Larynx] feature to explain both vowel height and consonant voicing in this language. I present an autosegmental analysis of the segment inventory and phonological patterns in the framework of the Parallel Structures Model of feature geometry (Morén 2003, 2006, 2007). This analysis provides a unified and minimal account of the assimilation facts and supports the claim that phonological activity is dependent on the structure of the contrast system of a given language (Dresher, Piggot & Rice 1994). Furthermore, the representational analysis fits neatly into a constraint-based model and contributes to the growing body of literature claiming that representations are important even to optimality-theoretic analyses.},

By comparison, language revival movements in Australia are in their infancy. This article provides comparative insights and makes information about the Hebrew revival accessible to Australian linguists and Aboriginal revival activists. Needless to say, the first stage of any desire by professional linguists to assist in language reawakening must involve a long period of thoroughly observing, carefully listening to the people, learning, mapping and characterizing the specific indigenous community. Only then can one inspire and assist. That said, this article proposes that there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would be useful to endangered languages in general and to Aboriginal linguistic revival in particular. This article contributes towards the establishment of Revival Linguistics, a new linguistic discipline and paradigm. Zuckermann's term Revival Linguistics is modelled upon `Contact Linguistics' (<language contact). Revival Linguistics inter alia explores the universal constraints and mechanisms involved in language reclamation, renewal and revitalization. It draws perspicacious comparative insights from one revival attempt to another, thus acting as an epistemological bridge between parallel discourses in various local attempts to revive sleeping tongues all over the globe.

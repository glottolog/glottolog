    abstract = {(Whole article): Thousands of the world’s languages are vanishing at an alarming rate, with 90% of them being expected to disappear with the current generation1. Here we develop a simple model of language competition that explains historical data on the decline of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Quechua (the most common surviving indigenous language in the Americas) and other endangered languages. A linguistic parameter that quantifies the threat of language extinction can be derived from the model and may be useful in the design and evaluation of language-preservation programmes. Previous models of language dynamics have focused on the transmission and evolution of syntax, grammar or other structural properties of a language itself 2–7. In contrast, the model we describe here idealizes languages as fixed, and as competing with each other for speakers. For simplicity, we also assume a highly connected population,with no spatial or social structure, in which all speakers are monolingual. Consider a system of two competing languages, X and Y,in which the attractiveness of a language increases with both its number of speakers and its perceived status8 (a parameter that reflects the social or economic opportunities afforded to its speakers). Suppose an individual converts from Y to X with a probability, per unit of time, of Pyx(x,s), where x is the fraction of the population speaking X, and 0 s 1 is a measure of X’s relative status. A minimal model for language change is therefore d—x yPyx(x,s) xPxy(x,s) (1) dt where y 1 x is the complementary fraction of the population speaking Y at time t. By symmetry, interchanging languages should yield the same transition probability as a swap in the fraction of speakers and relative status; thus Pxy(x,s) Pyx(1 x,1 s). We also assume that no one will adopt a language that has no speakers (Pyx(0,s) 0) or no status (Pyx(x,0) 0), and that Pyx is smooth and monotonically increasing in both arguments. These mild assumptions imply that equation (1) generically has three fixed points.Of these, only x 0 and x 1 are stable. The model therefore predicts that two languages cannot coexist stably — one will eventually drive the other to extinction. To test our model, we collected data on the number of speakers of endangered languages in 42 regions of Peru,Scotland,Wales, Bolivia, Ireland and Alsace-Lorraine, four instances of which are shown in Fig. 1.We fit the model’s solutions to the data, assuming transition functions of the forms Pyx(x,s) cxas and Pxy(x,s) c(1 x)a(1 s). Unexpectedly, the exponent a was found to be roughly constant across cultures, with a 1.31 0.25 (mean standard deviation; further details are available from the authors). Of the remaining parameters, status, s, is the most relevant linguistically; it could serve as a useful measure of the threat to a given language. Quechua, for example, still has many speakers in Huanuco, Peru, but its low status is driving a rapid shift to Spanish, which leads to an unfortunate situation in which a child cannot communicate with his or her grandparents. Contrary to the model’s stark prediction, bilingual societies do, in fact, exist. But the histories of countries where two languages coexist today generally involve split populations that lived without significant interaction, effectively in separate, monolingual societies. Only recently have these communities begun to mix, allowing language competition to begin. So what can be done to prevent the rapid disintegration of our world’s linguistic heritage? The example of Quebec French demonstrates that language decline can be slowed by strategies such as policy-making, education and advertising, in essence increasing an endangered language’s status. An extension to equation (1) that incorporates such control on s through active feedback does indeed show stabilization of a bilingual fixed point.},

    abstract = {The seemingly limitless diversity of proteins in nature arose from only a few thousand domain prototypes, but the origin of these themselves has remained unclear. We are pursuing the hypothesis that they arose by fusion and accretion from an ancestral set of peptides active as co-factors in RNA-dependent replication and catalysis. Should this be true, contemporary domains may still contain vestiges of such peptides, which could be reconstructed by a comparative approach in the same way in which ancient vocabularies have been reconstructed by the comparative study of modern languages. To test this, we compared domains representative of known folds and identified 40 fragments whose similarity is indicative of common descent, yet which occur in domains currently not thought to be homologous. These fragments are widespread in the most ancient folds and enriched for iron-sulfur- and nucleic acid-binding. We propose that they represent the observable remnants of a primordial RNA-peptide world.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09410.001},

Words were considered highly consistent if the authors used them with the same neighborhood. When ranked according to the consistency of use, the words obeyed a log-normal distribution, in contrast to Zipf's law that applies to the frequency of use. Consistency correlated positively with the familiarity and frequency of use, and negatively with ambiguity and age of acquisition. An inspection of some highly consistent words confirmed that they are used in very limited semantic contexts. A comparison of consistency indices for eight authors indicated that these indices may be employed for author recognition. Indeed, as expected, authors of novels could be distinguished from those who wrote scientific texts. Our analysis demonstrated the suitability of the consistency indices, which can now be applied in other tasks, such as emotion recognition.},

Numerous improvements of these two clustering methods have been introduced, as well as completely different approaches such as grid-based, density-based and model-based clustering. For improved bioinformatics analysis of data, it is important to match clusterings to the requirements of a biomedical application. In this article, we present a set of desirable clustering features that are used as evaluation criteria for clustering algorithms. We review 40 different clustering algorithms of all approaches and datatypes. We compare algorithms on the basis of desirable clustering features, and outline algorithms' benefits and drawbacks as a basis for matching them to biomedical applications.},

    abstract = {This paper is a report of the preliminary results of an attempt to reconstruct Proto-Chinese based on linguistic data from modern Chinese dialects. Ever since Karlgren, Etudes sur la phonologie chinoise. Archives d'études orientales. (1915), studies in Chinese historical linguistics have been following the same approach: take one of the ancient rhyme tables as the starting point and give a phonetic representation to each of the sound categories in the table, drawing evidence from sources such as modern dialects, Sinoxenic pronunciations, etc. This approach has been sharply criticized by Norman, Chinese. (1988), who suggested an alternative approach: ignore the ancient rhyme dictionaries and rhyme tables and work backward from modern dialects on. This paper supports and argues for this position. Based on systematic cognate correspondence sets in 17 Chinese dialects collected from Hanyu Fangyan Zihui [A Collection of Chinese Characters with Dialectal Pronunciations], a Proto-Chinese sound system is reconstructed with 29 onsets and 74 rhymes, which is simpler and more natural than the 37 onset and 139 rhyme system Karlgren reconstructed. Various rules of sound change are proposed to account for the modern dialectal reflexes of the proto-forms. Irregularities are discussed in light of recent theories of language change, in particular the theory of lexical diffusion. Based on the proposed rules of sound change, a family tree model is built to illustrate the subgrouping relationship among the dialects under investigation.},

    abstract = {Developing a cross-linguistic naming test has represented a challenge in language evaluation. In this paper, it is proposed that a cross-linguistic naming test should fulfill at least the following three criteria: (1) include only “universal” words found across different languages. The basic cross-linguistic core vocabulary is usually referred as the “Swadesh word list”; (2) include different semantic categories (e.g., living and nonliving elements); and (3) avoid the confounding of perceptual difficulties. Departing from the Swadesh word list, a cross-linguistic naming test was developed, including six different semantic categories: (a) body-parts (10 words), (b) natural phenomena (non-touchable) (5 words), (c) external objects (potentially known through the sight and the touch) (5 words), (d) animals (5 words), (e) colors (5 words), and (f) actions (10 words). A total of 40 color pictures were selected to represent these basic words. It is emphasized that this test has two major advantages: on one hand, it is readily available in hundreds of different languages; and, on the other hand, it is not a “fixed” test, but it includes photographs that can be replaced. Theoretically, norms are not required, and it represents a low-ceiling test. Word frequency can be used as a criterion of the level of difficulty. The next step will be to find the performance profile in different language pathologies, as well as the decline pattern in cases of dementia.},

This argument, as I shall develop it, turns on cases of what I call lexical innovation: cases in which a speaker uses a sentence containing a novel expression-meaning pair, but nevertheless successfully communicates her intended meaning to her audience. I will argue that cases of lexical innovation motivate a dynamic conception of linguistic conventions according to which background linguistic conventions may be rapidly expanded to incorporate new word meanings or shifted to revise the meanings of words already in circulation. I argue that this dynamic account of conventions both resolves the problem raised by cases of lexical innovation and that it does so in a way that is preferable to those who--like Davidson--deny important explanatory roles for linguistic conventions.},

    abstract = {Recently, a random breakage model has been proposed to explain the negative correlation between mean chromosome length and chromosome number that is found in many groups of species and is consistent with Menzerath–Altmann law, a statistical law that defines the dependency between the mean size of the whole and the number of parts in quantitative linguistics. Here, the central assumption of the model, namely that genome size is independent from chromosome number is reviewed. This assumption is shown to be unrealistic from the perspective of chromosome structure and the statistical analysis of real genomes. A general class of random models, including that random breakage model, is analyzed. For any model within this class, a power law with an exponent of −1 is predicted for the expectation of the mean chromosome size as a function of chromosome length, a functional dependency that is not supported by real genomes. The random breakage and variants keeping genome size and chromosome number independent raise no serious objection to the relevance of correlations consistent with Menzerath–Altmann law across taxonomic groups and the possibility of a connection between human language and genomes through that law.},

While such anti-homophony is mostly assumed implicitly, Müller (2004) spells it out more explicitly as violable Syncretism Principle guiding both language acquisition and linguistic analysis (`same form \textrightarrow same meaning'). However, as soon as the child or linguist decomposes word forms into smaller formatives (morpheme segmentation, subanalysis), it is unclear what instances of form-identity exactly are to be avoided (e.g. substring-identities?). This paper frames the logical space of possible Syncretism Principle interpretations, which relate to their functional motivation (ambiguity avoidance) demonstrating their concrete consequences for analysis with a paradigm learning algorithm offering segmentation and meaning assignment.},

    abstract = {The concept of a tree of life is prevalent in the evolutionary literature. It stems from attempting to obtain a grand unified natural system that reflects a recurrent process of species and lineage splittings for all forms of life. Traditionally, the discipline of systematics operates in a similar hierarchy of bifurcating (sometimes multifurcating) categories. The assumption of a universal tree of life hinges upon the process of evolution being tree-like throughout all forms of life and all of biological time. In multicellular eukaryotes, the molecular mechanisms and species-level population genetics of variation do indeed mainly cause a tree-like structure over time. In prokaryotes, they do not. Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different things, and we need to treat them as such, rather than extrapolating from macroscopic life to prokaryotes. In the following we will consider this circumstance from philosophical, scientific, and epistemological perspectives, surmising that phylogeny opted for a single model as a holdover from the Modern Synthesis of evolution.\\ It was far easier to envision and defend the concept of a universal tree of life before we had data from genomes. But the belief that prokaryotes are related by such a tree has now become stronger than the data to support it. The monistic concept of a single universal tree of life appears, in the face of genome data, increasingly obsolete. This traditional model to describe evolution is no longer the most scientifically productive position to hold, because of the plurality of evolutionary patterns and mechanisms involved. Forcing a single bifurcating scheme onto prokaryotic evolution disregards the non-tree-like nature of natural variation among prokaryotes and accounts for only a minority of observations from genomes.\\ Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different things. Hence we will briefly set out alternative models to the tree of life to study their evolution. Ultimately, the plurality of evolutionary patterns and mechanisms involved, such as the discontinuity of the process of evolution across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide, summons forth a pluralistic approach to studying evolution.\\ This article was reviewed by Ford Doolittle, John Logsdon and Nicolas Galtier.},

    abstract = {All evolutionary biologists are familiar with evolutionary units that evolve by vertical descent in a tree-like fashion in single lineages. However, many other kinds of processes contribute to evolutionary diversity. In vertical descent, the genetic material of a particular evolutionary unit is propagated by replication inside its own lineage. In what we call introgressive descent, the genetic material of a particular evolutionary unit propagates into different host structures and is replicated within these host structures. Thus, introgressive descent generates a variety of evolutionary units and leaves recognizable patterns in resemblance networks. We characterize six kinds of evolutionary units, of which five involve mosaic lineages generated by introgressive descent. To facilitate detection of these units in resemblance networks, we introduce terminology based on two notions, P3s (subgraphs of three nodes: A, B, and C) and mosaic P3s, and suggest an apparatus for systematic detection of introgressive descent. Mosaic P3s correspond to a distinct type of evolutionary bond that is orthogonal to the bonds of kinship and genealogy usually examined by evolutionary biologists. We argue that recognition of these evolutionary bonds stimulates radical rethinking of key questions in evolutionary biology (e.g., the relations among evolutionary players in very early phases of evolutionary history, the origin and emergence of novelties, and the production of new lineages). This line of research will expand the study of biological complexity beyond the usual genealogical bonds, revealing additional sources of biodiversity. It provides an important step to a more realistic pluralist treatment of evolutionary complexity.},

    abstract = {Numerous eukaryotic proteins contain multiple domains. Certain domains show a tendency to occur in diverse domain architectures and can be considered “promiscuous.” These promiscuous domains are, typically, involved in protein–protein interactions and play crucial roles in interaction networks, particularly those that contribute to signal transduction. A systematic comparative-genomic analysis of promiscuous domains in eukaryotes is described. Two quantitative measures of domain promiscuity are introduced and applied to the analysis of 28 genomes of diverse eukaryotes. Altogether, 215 domains are identified as strongly promiscuous. The fraction of promiscuous domains in animals is shown to be significantly greater than that in fungi or plants. Evolutionary reconstructions indicate that domain promiscuity is a volatile, relatively fast-changing feature of eukaryotic proteins, with few domains remaining promiscuous throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. Some domains appear to have attained promiscuity independently in different lineages, for example, animals and plants. It is proposed that promiscuous domains persist within a relatively small pool of evolutionarily stable domain combinations from which numerous rare architectures emerge during evolution. Domain promiscuity positively correlates with the number of experimentally detected domain interactions and with the strength of purifying selection affecting a domain. Thus, evolution of promiscuous domains seems to be constrained by the diversity of their interaction partners. The set of promiscuous domains is enriched for domains mediating protein–protein interactions that are involved in various forms of signal transduction, especially in the ubiquitin system and in chromatin. Thus, a limited repertoire of promiscuous domains makes a major contribution to the diversity and evolvability of eukaryotic proteomes and signaling networks.},

The mathematical structure we construct similarly has correspondences with the Fisher-Wright model of population genetics, but there are significant differences. The continuous time formulation of the model is expressed in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation. This equation is exactly soluble in the case of a single speaker and can be investigated analytically in the case of multiple speakers who communicate equally with all other speakers and give their utterances equal weight. Whilst the stationary properties of this system have much in common with the single-speaker case, time-dependent properties are richer. In the particular case where linguistic forms can become extinct, we find that the presence of many speakers causes a two-stage relaxation, the first being a common marginal distribution that persists for a long time as a consequence of ultimate extinction being due to rare fluctuations.},

    abstract = {We introduce several forest-based and network-based methods for exploring microbial evolution, and apply them to the study of thousands of genes from 30 strains of E. coli. This case study illustrates how additional analyses could offer fast heuristic alternatives to standard tree of life (TOL) approaches.\\ We use gene networks to identify genes with atypical modes of evolution, and genome networks to characterize the evolution of genetic partnerships between E. coli and mobile genetic elements. We develop a novel polychromatic quartet method to capture patterns of recombination within E. coli, to update the clanistic toolkit, and to search for the impact of lateral gene transfer and of pathogenicity on gene evolution in two large forests of trees bearing E. coli. We unravel high rates of lateral gene transfer involving E. coli (about 40% of the trees under study), and show that both core genes and shell genes of E. coli are affected by non-tree-like evolutionary processes. We show that pathogenic lifestyle impacted the structure of 30% of the gene trees, and that pathogenic strains are more likely to transfer genes with one another than with non-pathogenic strains. In addition, we propose five groups of genes as candidate mobile modules of pathogenicity. We also present strong evidence for recent lateral gene transfer between E. coli and mobile genetic elements.\\ Depending on which evolutionary questions biologists want to address (i.e. the identification of modules, genetic partnerships, recombination, lateral gene transfer, or genes with atypical evolutionary modes, etc.), forest-based and network-based methods are preferable to the reconstruction of a single tree, because they provide insights and produce hypotheses about the dynamics of genome evolution, rather than the relative branching order of species and lineages. Such a methodological pluralism - the use of woods and webs - is to be encouraged to analyse the evolutionary processes at play in microbial evolution.This manuscript was reviewed by: Ford Doolittle, Tal Pupko, Richard Burian, James McInerney, Didier Raoult, and Yan Boucher.},

We find that the functionality of a Common Slavic grammeme, together with the functionality of its category, is a significant predictor of its survivability in modern Slavic languages. The least functional grammemes within the most functional categories are most likely to die out.},

Clustering sequences into families is at the heart of most comparative studies dealing with protein evolution, structure, and function. Many methods have been developed for this task, and they perform reasonably well (over 0.88 of F-measure) when grouping proteins with high sequence identity. However, for highly diverged proteins the performance of these methods can be much lower, mainly because a common evolutionary origin is not deduced directly from sequence similarity. To the best of our knowledge, a systematic evaluation of clustering methods over distant homologous proteins is still lacking.},

This upper bound is the best possible, given information of just the vertices and the number of edges. Next we show that there exists an optimal partition in which one of the cliques is a maximal clique. Finally we present two new efficient methods to clique-partition a graph. Since the clique-partitioning of a graph is equivalent to the coloring of the complement of the graph, any coloring algorithm can also be used to clique-partition a graph. We present detailed statistics comparing the performance of our algorithms against two of the best known coloring algorithms and against a recently published clique-partitioning algorithm. Both functional and timing comparisons are given and we show that our algorithms compare very favorably on both counts.},

Words that were ambiguous as to grammatical category were disambiguated: Verbs were shown in their infinitival form, and nouns (where appropriate) were preceded by the indefinite article (such as to crack and a crack). Subjects were speakers of British English selected from a wide age range, so that differences in the responses across age groups could be compared. Within the subset of early acquired noun/verb homonyms, the verb forms were rated as later acquired than the nouns, and the verb homonyms of high-imageability nouns were rated as significantly less imageable than their noun counterparts. A small number of words received significantly earlier or later age of acquisition ratings when the 20-40 years and 50-80 years age groups were compared. These tend to comprise words that have come to be used more frequently in recent years (either through technological advances or social change), or those that have fallen out of common usage. Regression analyses showed that although word length, familiarity, and concreteness make independent contributions to the age of acquisition measure, frequency and imageability are the most important predictors of rated age of acquisition.},

    abstract = {The Himalaya and surrounding regions are amongst the world's most linguistically diverse places. Of an estimated 600 languages spoken here at Asia's heart, few are researched in depth and many virtually undocumented. Historical developments and relationships between the region's languages also remain poorly understood. Thisbook brings together new work on under-researched Himalayan languages with investigations into the complexities of the area's linguistic history, offering original data and perspectives on the synchrony and diachrony of the Greater Himalayan Region. The volume arises from papers given and topics discussed at the 16th Himalayan Languages Symposium in London in 2010. Most papers focus on Tibeto-Burman languages. These include topics relating to individual - mostly small and endangered - languages, such as Tilung, Shumcho, Rengmitca, Yongning Na and Tshangla; comparative research on the Tibetic, East Bodish and Tamangic language groups; and several papers whose scope covers the whole language family. The remaining paper deals with the origins of Burushaski, whose genetic affiliation remains uncertain. This book will be of special interest to scholars of Tibeto-Burman, and historical as well as general linguists.},

    abstract = {Linguistic problems of the past, and the problems of kinship of languages in particular, have attracted very little attention. Still, what our ancestors believed or thought or hoped about their own language, or the langauge of their ancestors or of their neighbors, about their differences and affinities, was important to them, not only were scholars interested in these questions: the thinking of the leading classes was also influenced by them, and also that of the peoples in general. It is true that the history of past science is largely the history of errors; but these errors - even if they were errors, and they frequently are not - still constitute the history of human thinking, and are therefore not alien to us. This paper will be devoted to the question of the kinship of the European languages. here the lack of information of our contemporary books and encycloedias is appalling. the work of centuries ahs simply been entirely forgotten or neglected. Our predecessors are accused more or less openly of an ignorance which is not theirs, but ours. Concerning the kinship of the Indo-European languages, most handbooks attribute the discovery to the XIXth century, startin with Bopp; some mention Schlegel, Rask, W. Jones, Adelung; a few (very few) got back to Cœurdoux and Sassetti. Names like Dante, Scaliger, Leibniz, Vico go unheeded. The material I will present in this paper, although far from being exhaustive, should give a much more complete picture of this question than is found in other works},

    abstract = {<p>We present a new open source, extensible and flexible software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis called BEAST 2. This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.</p>},

    abstract = {Recent advances in heuristics have made maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree estimation tractable for hundreds of sequences. Noticeably, these algorithms are currently limited to reversible models of evolution, in which Felsenstein's pulley principle applies. In this paper we show that by reorganizing the way likelihood is computed, one can efficiently compute the likelihood of a tree from any of its nodes with a nonreversible model of DNA sequence evolution, and hence benefit from cutting-edge heuristics. This computational trick can be used with reversible models of evolution without any extra cost. We then introduce nhPhyML, the adaptation of the nonhomogeneous nonstationary model of Galtier and Gouy (1998; Mol. Biol. Evol. 15:871-879) to the structure of PhyML, as well as an approximation of the model in which the set of equilibrium frequencies is limited. This new version shows good results both in terms of exploration of the space of tree topologies and ancestral G+C content estimation. We eventually apply it to rRNA sequences slowly evolving sites and conclude that the model and a wider taxonomic sampling still do not plead for a hyperthermophilic last universal common ancestor.},

Here, we investigated such arbitrary conceptual relationships using a non-linguistic picture relatedness task in participants undergoing event-related brain potential recordings. Picture pairs arbitrarily related because of a compound and presented in the compound order elicited N400 amplitudes similar to unrelated pairs. Surprisingly, however, pictures presented in the reverse order (as in the sequence horse–sea) reduced N400 amplitudes significantly, demonstrating the existence of a link in memory between these two concepts otherwise unrelated. These results break new ground in the domain of linguistic relativity by revealing predicted semantic associations driven by lexical relations intrinsic to language.},

    abstract = {<p>In recent years, linguists have begun to increasingly rely on quantitative phylogenetic approaches to examine language evolution. Some linguists have questioned the suitability of phylogenetic approaches on the grounds that linguistic evolution is largely reticulate due to extensive lateral transmission, or borrowing, among languages. The problem may be particularly pronounced in hunter-gatherer languages, where the conventional wisdom among many linguists is that lexical borrowing rates are so high that tree building approaches cannot provide meaningful insights into evolutionary processes. However, this claim has never been systematically evaluated, in large part because suitable data were unavailable. In addition, little is known about the subsistence, demographic, ecological, and social factors that might mediate variation in rates of borrowing among languages. Here, we evaluate these claims with a large sample of hunter-gatherer languages from three regions around the world. In this study, a list of 204 basic vocabulary items was collected for 122 hunter-gatherer and small-scale cultivator languages from three ecologically diverse case study areas: northern Australia, northwest Amazonia, and California and the Great Basin. Words were rigorously coded for etymological (inheritance) status, and loan rates were calculated. Loan rate variability was examined with respect to language area, subsistence mode, and population size, density, and mobility; these results were then compared to the sample of 41 primarily agriculturalist languages in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025195-Haspelmath1">[1]</xref>. Though loan levels varied both within and among regions, they were generally low in all regions (mean 5.06%, median 2.49%, and SD 7.56), despite substantial demographic, ecological, and social variation. Amazonian levels were uniformly very low, with no language exhibiting more than 4%. Rates were low but more variable in the other two study regions, in part because of several outlier languages where rates of borrowing were especially high. High mobility, prestige asymmetries, and language shift may contribute to the high rates in these outliers. No support was found for claims that hunter-gatherer languages borrow more than agriculturalist languages. These results debunk the myth of high borrowing in hunter-gatherer languages and suggest that the evolution of these languages is governed by the same type of rules as those operating in large-scale agriculturalist speech communities. The results also show that local factors are likely to be more critical than general processes in determining high (or low) loan rates.</p>},

    abstract = {We present the first proposal of detailed internal subgrouping and higher-order structure of the Pama-Nyungan family of Australian languages. Previous work has identified more than twenty- five primary subgroups in the family, with little indication of how these groups might fit together. Some work has assumed that reconstruction of higher nodes in the tree was impossible, either be- cause extensive internal borrowing has obscured more remote relations, or because the languages are not sufficiently well attested (see, for example, Bowern & Koch 2004b, Dixon 1997). With re- gard to the first objection, work by Alpher and Nash (1999) and Bowern and colleagues (2011) shows that loan levels are not high enough to obscure vertical transmission for all but a few lan- guages. New data remove the second objection. Here we use Bayesian phylogenetic inference to show that the Pama-Nyungan tree has a discernible internal subgrouping. We identify four major divisions within the family and discuss the implications of this grouping for future work on the family.},

The key finding was that autonomic responses to swear words were larger than to euphemisms and neutral stimuli. It is argued that the heightened response to swear words reflects a form of verbal conditioning in which the phonological form of the word is directly associated with an affective response. Euphemisms are effective because they replace the trigger (the offending word form) by another word form that expresses a similar idea. That is, word forms exert some control on affect and cognition in turn. We relate these findings to the linguistic relativity hypothesis, and suggest a simple mechanistic account of how language may influence thinking in this context.</p>},

    abstract = {The effect of population size on patterns and rates of language evolution is controversial. Do languages with larger speaker populations change faster due to a greater capacity for innovation, or do smaller populations change faster due to more efficient diffusion of innovations? Do smaller populations suffer greater loss of language elements through founder effects or drift, or do languages with more speakers lose features due to a process of simplification? Revealing the influence of population size on the tempo and mode of language evolution not only will clarify underlying mechanisms of language change but also has practical implications for the way that language data are used to reconstruct the history of human cultures. Here, we provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical, statistically robust test of the influence of population size on rates of language evolution, controlling for the evolutionary history of the populations and formally comparing the fit of different models of language evolution. We compare rates of gain and loss of cognate words for basic vocabulary in Polynesian languages, an ideal test case with a well-defined history. We demonstrate that larger populations have higher rates of gain of new words whereas smaller populations have higher rates of word loss. These results show that demographic factors can influence rates of language evolution and that rates of gain and loss are affected differently. These findings are strikingly consistent with general predictions of evolutionary models.},

    abstract = {One of the major benefits of interdisciplinary research is the chance to swap tools between fields, to save having to reinvent the wheel. The fields of language evolution and evolutionary biology have been swapping tools for centuries to the enrichment of both. Here I will discuss three categories of tool swapping: (1) conceptual tools, where analogies are drawn between hypotheses, patterns or processes, so that one field can take advantage of the path cut through the intellectual jungle by the other; (2) theoretical tools, where the machinery developed to process the data in one field is adapted to be applied to the data of the other; and (3) analytical tools, where common problems encountered in both fields can be solved using useful tricks developed by one or the other. I will argue that conceptual tools borrowed from linguistics contributed to the Darwinian revolution in biology; that theoretical tools of evolutionary change can in some cases be applied to both genetic and linguistic data without having to assume the underlying evolutionary processes are exactly the same; and that there are practical problems that have long been recognised in historical linguistics that may be solved by borrowing some useful analytical tools from evolutionary biology.},

Proposed cognate sets comparing words reconstructed for Proto-Totonacan (PTn) and Proto-Mixe-Zoquean (PMZ) show regular sound correspondences attesting to the descent of these two languages from Proto-Totozoquean (PTz). Identification of sound correspondences facilitates reconstruction of PTz’s phonological inventory and vocabulary. The PMZ words used in the comparison are from Wichmann (1995). The PTn words are reconstructed by the authors, who provide the Totonacan cognate sets on which these reconstructions are based, as well as discussion of the classification and phonological history of Totonacan languages. Evidence is cited indicating that Totozoquean is comparable to Indo-European in chronological depth.},

The numbers range from 27,000 lemmas for the lowest 5% to 52,000 for the highest 5%. Between the ages of 20 and 60, the average person learns 6,000 extra lemmas or about one new lemma every two days.

The reduced version was found to be equivalent to the complete BNT, and to have criterion validity with respect to other measures of dementia. We conclude that the reduced version is a useful instrument for assessing patients who require shorter testing methods because of severe cognitive deterioration or their low level of education.},

I show that, in most cases, these hypotheses can be rejected because the Arawak forms in question either have clear internal etymologies or because the noted similarities are too superfcial and no coherent or plausible picture for the phonological deviation between the putative loans and their presumed source forms can be oﬀered. In advancing internal etymologies for the target Arawak forms I will also try to cast light on aspects of the historical developments of these languages, as well as raise some so far unacknowledged issues for future research. Next, I consider some plausible cases of Guarani loans in one Southern Arawak language, Terena, explicitly arguing for these contact etymologies and placing these loanwords within a chronological stratum in Terena history. Complications related to dissimilar sources in Arawak-TupiGuarani contact and to the status of Wanderwörter are also brieﬂy addressed.},

As available software packages implementing the global maximum parsimony (MP) approach only give the possibility to merge resulting topologies into less-resolved consensus trees, MP has often been neglected as an alternative approach to purely algorithmic (i.e., methods defined solely on the basis of an algorithm) "network" construction methods. Here, we propose to search tree space using the MP criterion and present a new algorithm for uniting all equally most parsimonious trees into a single (possibly reticulated) graph. Using simulated sequence data, we compare our method with three purely algorithmic and widely used graph construction approaches (minimum-spanning network, statistical parsimony, and median-joining network). We demonstrate that the combination of MP trees into a single graph provides a good estimate of the true genealogy. Moreover, our analyses indicate that, when internal node haplotypes are not sampled, the median-joining and MP methods provide the best estimate of the true genealogy whereas the minimum-spanning algorithm shows very poor performances.},

    abstract = {There has been much debate regarding the internal history of the Tukanoan languages dur- ing the last four decades, with different classification proposals being based on lexical and phonological data. Here, we present a new classification of the Tukanoan language family based on an improved computational approach which infers phylogenetic trees from pro- posed sound change patterns. In contrast to traditional methods based on the manual identi- fication of shared innovations by experts, our method identifies valid innovations within a parsimony framework. In contrast to existing computational models which are mostly based on binary character states for lexical data, we model sound change patterns as directed weighted transitions between multiple character states. We apply the new approach to a set of 21 extant Tukano languages. Our results confirm the east-west split of the Tukanoan lan- guages which was proposed in the past and suggest a classification which groups Kubeo with Tanimuka on the one hand, and Koreguahe with Maihiki, on the other hand, thus rec- onciling previous classifications. We use this new classification to propose a consensus phy- logeny of Tukanoan in which all automatically inferred shared innovations were manually checked and uncertainties are explicitly displayed. За последние сорок лет внутренняя история языков тукано была в центре множества дискуссий; предлагались самые разные классификации, основанные на лексических и фонологических данных. Данная статья представляет новую классификацию языковой семьи тукано, основанную на улучшенном компьютеризированном подходе, который реконструирует филогенетическое дерево исходя из предлагаемых звуковых изменений. В отличие от традиционного метода, который основан на ручной идентификации общих инноваций лингвистами, новый метод определяет инновации по принципу бережливости (parsimony). В отличие от моделей с бинарными признаками, пользующихся большой популярностью при анализе лексики, звуковые изменения описываются авторами как направленные взвешенные переходы между несколькими состояниями признака. Авторы применяют свой алгоритм к выборке из 21 современного языка семьи тукано. Результаты подтверждают бинарное разделение языков тукано на западную и восточную ветви, которое уже было ранее предложено, а также указывают на генетическую близость между, с одной стороны, языками кубео и танимука, с другой — корегуахе и маихики, таким образом, примиряя друг с другом предыдущие классификации. Авторы используют полученную классификацию для реконструкции консенсусного филогенетического дерева, в котором все общие инновации проверены вручную и для всех неточностей предлагаются детальные объяснения.},

We extend known relations between random walks and electrical networks by showing that resistance in this network is intimately connected with thelengths of random walks on the graph. For example, thecommute time between two verticess andt (the expected length of a random walk froms tot and back) is precisely characterized by the effective resistanceR st betweens andt: commute time=2mR st . As a corollary, thecover time (the expected length of a random walk visiting all vertices) is characterized by the maximum resistanceR in the graph to within a factor of logn:mR<-cover time<-O(mRlogn). For many graphs, the bounds on cover time obtained in this manner are better than those obtained from previous techniques such as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In particular, we improve known bounds on cover times for high-degree graphs and expanders, and give new proofs of known results for multi-dimensional meshes. Moreover, resistance seems to provide an intuitively appealing and tractable approach to these problems.},

To examine this, we determined a wide variety of topologically distinct contour configurations and examined the relative frequency of these configuration types across writing systems, Chinese writing, and nonlinguistic symbols. Our first result is that these three classes of human visual sign possess a similar signature in their configuration distribution, suggesting that there are underlying principles governing the shapes of human visual signs. Second, we provide evidence that the shapes of visual signs are selected to be easily seen at the expense of the motor system. Finally, we provide evidence to support an ecological hypothesis that visual signs have been culturally selected to match the kinds of conglomeration of contours found in natural scenes because that is what we have evolved to be good at visually processing.},

Fruit de dix ans de collaboration entre deux linguistes du CNRS, Jean-Michel Charpentier et Alexandre François, l’Atlas Linguistique de la Polynésie Française rend hommage à ce riche paysage linguistique et dialectal en documentant minutieusement vingt parlers différents du territoire, à l’aide de plus de 2250 cartes. Organisées thématiquement – corps, vie, individu et société, culture et techniques, flore et faune – ces cartes lexicales s’accompagnent de notes explicatives et d’index en français, anglais, tahitien. Des chapitres introductifs présentent le contexte social et la dynamique historique des langues de Polynésie Française, toutes plus ou moins fragilisées par la modernité. Publié en accès libre, cet ouvrage multilingue et comparatif s’adresse non seulement aux chercheurs et aux enseignants, mais aussi à tous ceux que passionne le patrimoine linguistique de cette région du Pacifique. The vast territory of French Polynesia is home to seven distinct languages – Tahitian, Austral, Rapa, Mangarevan, North Marquesan, South Marquesan, and Pa’umotu – which in turn show internal variation. The fruit of ten years of joint work by two linguists of French CNRS, Jean-Michel Charpentier and Alexandre François, the Linguistic Atlas of French Polynesia pays tribute to the rich linguistic landscape of the country by documenting thoroughly twenty different communalects, in the form of 2250 maps. Organised by topics (body, life, individual and society, culture and technology, flora and fauna), these lexical maps are supplemented by explanatory notes and indexes in French, English, Tahitian. Text chapters in French and English present the social profile and the historical dynamics of the territory’s languages, which are all endangered to various extents. Published in open access, this multilingual and comparative atlas provides an essential reference to scholars and teachers alike, as well as to a broader audience keen to explore and preserve the linguistic heritage of the Pacific region. Tahitian translation is available as supplementary material on this page.},

    abstract = {Dissociations between noun and verb processing are not uncommon after brain injury; yet, precise psycholinguistic comparisons of nouns and verbs are hampered by the underrepresentation of verbs in published semantic word norms and by the absence of contemporary estimates for part-of-speech usage. We report herein imageability ratings and rating response times (RTs) for 1,197 words previously categorized as pure nouns, pure verbs, or words of balanced noun-verb usage on the basis of the Francis and Kučera (1982) norms. Nouns and verbs differed in rated imageability, and there was a stronger correspondence between imageability rating and RT for nouns than for verbs. For all word types, the image-rating-RT function implied that subjects employed an image generation process to assign ratings. We also report a new measure of noun-verbtypicality that used the Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL; Lund & Burgess, 1996) context vectors (derived from a large sample of Usenet text) to compute the mean context distance between each word and all of thepure nouns andpure verbs. For a subset of the items, the resulting HAL noun-verb difference score was compared with part-of-speech usage in a representative sample of the Usenet corpus. It is concluded that this score can be used to estimate the extent to which a given word occurs in typical noun or verb sentence contexts in informal contemporary English discourse. The item statistics given in Appendix B will enable experimenters to select representative examples of nouns and verbs or to compare typical with atypical nouns (or verbs), while holding constant or covarying rated imageability.},

We use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms in order to infer rules for linguistic changes undergone by words when entering new languages and to discriminate between cognates and non-cognates. Given a list of known cognates, our approach does not require any other linguistic information. However, it can be customized to integrate historical information regarding language evolution.},

The first extension involved the collecting of a much more extensive and diverse set of properties from original ratings and other sources. Factor analysis of 32 properties identified 9 orthogonal factors and demonstrated both the redundancy among various measures and the tendency for some attributes (e.g., age of acquisition) to load on multiple factors. The second extension collected basic ratings of imagery, familiarity, and a new age of acquisition measure for a larger pool of 2,311 words, including parts of speech other than nouns. The analysis of these ratings and supplementary statistics computed for the words (e.g., number of syllables, Kucera-Francis frequency) demonstrated again the relative independence of various measures and the importance of obtaining diverse properties for such norms. Implications and directions for future research are considered. The full set of new norms may be downloaded from www. psychonomic.org/archive/.},

Australian linguistic diversity is explained in terms of climatic events at the end of the last ice agethose that brought about the evacuation of the central arid zone during it and the evacuation of the Arafuran floodplain after it. The argument advanced here crucially concerns the origin and nature of the PamaNyungan and nonPamaNyungan (Arafuran) language groups, and the implications of the model for this discussion are addressed.

Instead, we introduce here a measure of how word ranks change in time and call this distribution <italic>rank diversity</italic>. We calculate this diversity for books published in six European languages since 1800, and find that it follows a universal lognormal distribution. Based on the mean and standard deviation associated with the lognormal distribution, we define three different word regimes of languages: ?heads? consist of words which almost do not change their rank in time, ?bodies? are words of general use, while ?tails? are comprised by context-specific words and vary their rank considerably in time. The heads and bodies reflect the size of language cores identified by linguists for basic communication. We propose a Gaussian random walk model which reproduces the rank variation of words in time and thus the diversity. Rank diversity of words can be understood as the result of random variations in rank, where the size of the variation depends on the rank itself. We find that the core size is similar for all languages studied.</p>},

    abstract = {Bacterial evolution is characterized by frequent gain and loss events of gene families. These events can be inferred from phyletic pattern data—a compact representation of gene family repertoire across multiple genomes. The maximum parsimony paradigm is a classical and prevalent approach for the detection of gene family gains and losses mapped on specific branches. We and others have previously developed probabilistic models that aim to account for the gain and loss stochastic dynamics. These models are a critical component of a methodology termed stochastic mapping, in which probabilities and expectations of gain and loss events are estimated for each branch of an underlying phylogenetic tree. In this work, we present a phyletic pattern simulator in which the gain and loss dynamics are assumed to follow a continuous-time Markov chain along the tree. Various models and options are implemented to make the simulation software useful for a large number of studies in which binary (presence/absence) data are analyzed. Using this simulation software, we compared the ability of the maximum parsimony and the stochastic mapping approaches to accurately detect gain and loss events along the tree. Our simulations cover a large array of evolutionary scenarios in terms of the propensities for gene family gains and losses and the variability of these propensities among gene families. Although in all simulation schemes, both methods obtain relatively low levels of false positive rates, stochastic mapping outperforms maximum parsimony in terms of true positive rates. We further studied the factors that influence the performance of both methods. We find, for example, that the accuracy of maximum parsimony inference is substantially reduced when the goal is to map gain and loss events along internal branches of the phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, the accuracy of stochastic mapping is reduced with smaller data sets (limited number of gene families) due to unreliable estimation of branch lengths. Our simulator and simulation results are additionally relevant for the analysis of other types of binary-coded data, such as the existence of homologues restriction sites, gaps, and introns, to name a few. Both the simulation software and the inference methodology are freely available at a user-friendly server: http://gloome.tau.ac.il/.},

We propose a statistical model for inferring a blend's source words drawing on observed linguistic properties of blends; these properties are largely based on the recognizability of the source words in a blend. We annotate a set of 1,186 recently coined expressions which includes 515 blends, and evaluate our methods on a 324-item subset. In this first study of novel blends we achieve an accuracy of 40% on the task of inferring a blend's source words, which corresponds to a reduction in error rate of 39% over an informed baseline. We also give preliminary results showing that our features for source word identification can be used to distinguish blends from other kinds of novel words.},

One of the four, Naman: a vanishing language of Malakula (Vanuatu) , had been submitted to Pacific Linguistics a couple of weeks earlier, and the remaining three were in various stages of completion, and John Lynch was asked by the Board of Pacific Linguistics to prepare all four for publication, both as a memorial to Terry and because of the valuable data they contain. Avava currently falls into the category described in Lynch and Crowley (2001:14-19) as being among the most poorly documented of all languages in Vanuatu . Published documentation of this language by a linguist is restricted to two fairly short wordlists in Tryon (1976). In addition to this recent data, there is also a very small amount of published data on the Umbbuul variety of this language that can be extracted from Deacon (1934:125), which derives from his anthropological fieldwork in the area in 1926. This data, however, is restricted to just a small number of kin terms for each variety, with no other vocabulary having been recorded.},

    abstract = {Most current thinking about evolution is couched in the concept of trees. The notion of a tree with recursively bifurcating branches representing recurrent divergence events is a plausible metaphor to describe the evolution of multicellular organisms like vertebrates or land plants. But if we try to force the tree metaphor onto the whole of the evolutionary process, things go badly awry, because the more closely we inspect microbial genomes through the looking glass of gene and genome sequence comparisons, the smaller the amount of the data that fits the concept of a bifurcating tree becomes. That is mainly because among microbes, endosymbiosis and lateral gene transfer are important, two mechanisms of natural variation that differ from the kind of natural variation that Darwin had in mind. For such reasons, when it comes to discussing the relationships among all living things, that is, including the microbes and all of their genes rather than just one or a select few, many biologists are now beginning to talk about networks rather than trees in the context of evolutionary relationships among microbial chromosomes. But talk is not enough. If we were to actually construct networks instead of trees to describe the evolutionary process, what would they look like? Here we consider endosymbiosis and an example of a network of genomes involving 181 sequenced prokaryotes and how that squares off with some ideas about early cell evolution.},

We will argue that the phylogenetic networks approach proposed here is the most suitable for the classification of creole languages. At the same time, we will show that this tool can also be used to assess the degree of radicalness of a creole, another issue which has been at the heart of creole studies.},

Different approximations are generated depending on the choice of an aggregation operator that plays a central role in the algorithm. If the maximum operator is chosen, then the approximation coincides with the min-transitive closure of the given similarity matrix. In case of the arithmetic mean, a transitive approximation is generated which is, on the average, as close to the given similarity matrix as the approximation generated by the \UPGMA\ hierarchical clustering algorithm. The new algorithm also allows to generate approximations in a purely ordinal setting. As this new approach is weight-driven, the partition tree associated to the corresponding min-transitive approximation can be built layer by layer. Numerical tests carried out on synthetic data are used for comparing different approximations generated by the new algorithm with certain approximations obtained by classical methods.},

It is still debated whether structural features have intrinsic stabilities across language families and geographic areas, or if the processes governing their rate of change are completely dependent upon the specific context of a given language or language family. We conducted an extensive literature review and selected seven different approaches to conceptualising and estimating the stability of structural linguistic features, aiming at comparing them using the same dataset, the <italic>World Atlas of Language Structures</italic>. We found that, despite profound conceptual and empirical differences between these methods, they tend to agree in classifying some structural linguistic features as being more stable than others. This suggests that there are intrinsic properties of such structural features influencing their stability across methods, language families and geographic areas. This finding is a major step towards understanding the nature of structural linguistic features and their interaction with idiosyncratic, lineage- and area-specific factors during language change and evolution.</p>},

    abstract = {Abstract Language is not a purely cultural phenomenon somehow isolated from its wider environment, and we may only understand its origins and evolution by seriously considering its embedding in this environment as well as its multimodal nature. By environment here we understand other aspects of culture (such as communication technology, attitudes towards language contact, etc.), of the physical environment (ultraviolet light incidence, air humidity, etc.), and of the biological infrastructure for language and speech. We are specifically concerned in this paper with the latter, in the form of the biases, constraints and affordances that the anatomy and physiology of the vocal tract create on speech and language. In a nutshell, our argument is that (a) there is an under-appreciated amount of inter-individual variation in vocal tract (VT) anatomy and physiology, (b) variation that is non-randomly distributed across populations, and that (c) results in systematic differences in phonetics and phonology between languages. Relevant differences in \VT\ anatomy include the overall shape of the hard palate, the shape of the alveolar ridge, the relationship between the lower and upper jaw, to mention just a few, and our data offer a new way to systematically explore such differences and their potential impact on speech. These differences generate very small biases that nevertheless can be amplified by the repeated use and transmission of language, affecting language diachrony and resulting in cross-linguistic synchronic differences. Moreover, the same type of biases and processes might have played an essential role in the emergence and evolution of language, and might allow us a glimpse into the speech and language of extinct humans by, for example, reconstructing the anatomy of parts of their vocal tract from the fossil record and extrapolating the biases we find in present-day humans.},

    abstract = {V’ënen Taut: Grammatical Topics in The Big Nambas Language of Malekula presents a synchronic description of five different areas of the grammar of V’ënen Taut, a language spoken in Northwest Malekula in the Pacific nation of Vanuatu. The data used in this project comes from roughly three and a half hours of recorded speech collected during two field trips to the village of Tenmaru in 2013. The areas of interest for this publication are nouns and the noun phrase, verbal prefixes, verbal suffixes, post-verbal modification, and clause structure. V’ënen Taut is often mentioned in phonology publications due to its use of linguo-labial consonants. V’ënen Taut is noted amongst other Malekula languages as having very rich verbal morphology. This work recognises five distinct prefix positions, three distinct suffix positions, and pronominal enclitics. The first prefix positon is filled by morphemes which code both grammatical person and mood. V’ënen Taut makes four mood distinctions: realis, irrealis, conditional, and imperative. The fifth prefix position is filled by four morphemes which code grammatical number categories: singular, paucal, plural, and impersonal. Rather than using verbal serialisation to indicate complex events and actions, V’ënen Taut uses a well-developed echo-subject system. A wide variety of semantic modifier suffixes indicates that verbal serialisation may have been a more productive grammatical feature of V’ënen Taut in the past. In addition to the many bound verbal modifiers, there are numerous free post-verbal modifiers, some of which can be inflected by pronominal enclitics. The basic word order of V’ënen Taut is predominantly SVO; although, post-verbal arguments can be moved to a clause initial position through constituent fronting. V’ënen Taut has intransitive and transitive verbs and both of these verb classes can have their valence increased through the use of the extended participant preposition a/an. Grammatical relations are marked using the nominative-accusative case marking system encoded though constituent order and nominal agreement morphology on the verb},

    abstract = {Phylogenetic tree reconciliation is the approach of choice for investigating the coevolution of sets of organisms such as hosts and parasites. It consists in a mapping between the parasite tree and the host tree using event-based maximum parsimony. Given a cost model for the events, many optimal reconciliations are however possible. Any further biological interpretation of them must therefore take this into account, making the capacity to enumerate all optimal solutions a crucial point. Only two algorithms currently exist that attempt such enumeration; in one case not all possible solutions are produced while in the other not all cost vectors are currently handled. The objective of this paper is two-fold. The first is to fill this gap, and the second is to test whether the number of solutions generally observed can be an issue in terms of interpretation.\\ We present a polynomial-delay algorithm for enumerating all optimal reconciliations. We show that in general many solutions exist. We give an example where, for two pairs of host-parasite trees having each less than 41 leaves, the number of solutions is 5120, even when only time-feasible ones are kept. To facilitate their interpretation, those solutions are also classified in terms of how many of each event they contain. The number of different classes of solutions may thus be notably smaller than the number of solutions, yet they may remain high enough, in particular for the cases where losses have cost 0. In fact, depending on the cost vector, both numbers of solutions and of classes thereof may increase considerably. To further deal with this problem, we introduce and analyse a restricted version where host switches are allowed to happen only between species that are within some fixed distance along the host tree. This restriction allows us to reduce the number of time-feasible solutions while preserving the same optimal cost, as well as to find time-feasible solutions with a cost close to the optimal in the cases where no time-feasible solution is found.\\ We present Eucalypt, a polynomial-delay algorithm for enumerating all optimal reconciliations which is freely available at http://eucalypt.gforge.inria.fr/.},

We present the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software package version 1.7, which implements a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian phylogenetic inference, divergence time dating, coalescent analysis, phylogeography and related molecular evolutionary analyses. This package includes an enhanced graphical user interface program called Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility (BEAUti) that enables access to advanced models for molecular sequence and phenotypic trait evolution that were previously available to developers only. The package also provides new tools for visualizing and summarizing multispecies coalescent and phylogeographic analyses. BEAUti and BEAST 1.7 are open source under the GNU lesser general public license and available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com and http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk.},

    abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental data analysis method. It is widely used for pattern recognition, feature extraction, vector quantization (VQ), image segmentation, function approximation, and data mining. As an unsupervised classification technique, clustering identifies some inherent structures present in a set of objects based on a similarity measure. Clustering methods can be based on statistical model identification (McLachlan &amp; Basford, 1988) or competitive learning. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of competitive learning based clustering methods. Importance is attached to a number of competitive learning based clustering neural networks such as the self-organizing map (SOM), the learning vector quantization (LVQ), the neural gas, and the \ART\ model, and clustering algorithms such as the C -means, mountain/subtractive clustering, and fuzzy C -means (FCM) algorithms. Associated topics such as the under-utilization problem, fuzzy clustering, robust clustering, clustering based on non-Euclidean distance measures, supervised clustering, hierarchical clustering as well as cluster validity are also described. Two examples are given to demonstrate the use of the clustering methods.},

We develop in this thesis statistical tools to perform null hypothesis testing and clustering or classification on text-valued data in the framework of Object-Oriented Data Analysis. The project includes research on semantic methods to represent texts, comparisons between representations, distances for such representations and performance of permutation tests. Main methods compared are Vector Space Model and topic model. More precisely, this thesis will provide an algorithm to compute permutation tests at document or sentence level to study the equality in terms of distribution of two texts for different representations and distances. Lastly, we describe the study of texts regarding a syntactic point of view and its structure with a tree representation.},

An analysis of the functional characteristics shared by complex sequential behaviors suggests that they all present a common overarching computational problem: dynamically controlled constrained navigation in concrete or abstract situation spaces. With this conceptual framework in mind, I compare and contrast computational models of language and evaluate their potential for explaining linguistic behavior and for elucidating the brain mechanisms that support it.},

    abstract = {Motivation:In recent years, several methods have been proposed for aligning two protein sequence profiles, with reported improvements in alignment accuracy and homolog discrimination versus sequence-sequence methods (e.g. BLAST) and profile-sequence methods (e.g. PSI-BLAST). Profile-profile alignment is also the iterated step in progressive multiple sequence alignment algorithms such as CLUSTALW. However, little is known about the relative performance of different profile-profile scoring functions. In this work, we evaluate the alignment accuracy of 23 different profile-profile scoring functions by comparing alignments of 488 pairs of sequences with identity [<=]30% against structural alignments. We optimize parameters for all scoring functions on the same training set and use profiles of alignments from both PSI-BLAST and SAM-T99. Structural alignments are constructed from a consensus between the FSSP database and CE structural aligner. We compare the results with sequence-sequence and sequence-profile methods, including BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Results: We find that profile-profile alignment gives an average improvement over our test set of typically 2-3% over profile-sequence alignment and [~]40% over sequence-sequence alignment. No statistically significant difference is seen in the relative performance of most of the scoring functions tested. Significantly better results are obtained with profiles constructed from SAM-T99 alignments than from PSI-BLAST alignments.

    abstract = {Abstract In recent articles published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Mark Springer and John Gatesy (S&amp;G) present numerous criticisms of recent implementations and testing of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model in phylogenomics, popularly known as “species tree” methods. After pointing out errors in alignments and gene tree rooting in recent phylogenomic data sets, particularly in Song et al. (2012) on mammals and Xi et al. (2014) on plants, they suggest that these errors seriously compromise the conclusions of these studies. Additionally, S&amp;G enumerate numerous perceived violated assumptions and deficiencies in the application of the \MSC\ model in phylogenomics, such as its assumption of neutrality and in particular the use of transcriptomes, which are deemed inappropriate for the \MSC\ because the constituent exons often subtend large regions of chromosomes within which recombination is substantial. We acknowledge these previously reported errors in recent phylogenomic data sets, but disapprove of S&amp;G’s excessively combative and taunting tone. We show that these errors, as well as two nucleotide sorting methods used in the analysis of Amborella, have little impact on the conclusions of those papers. Moreover, several concepts introduced by S&amp;G and an appeal to “first principles” of phylogenetics in an attempt to discredit \MSC\ models are invalid and reveal numerous misunderstandings of the MSC. Contrary to the claims of S&amp;G we show that recent computer simulations used to test the robustness of \MSC\ models are not circular and do not unfairly favor \MSC\ models over concatenation. In fact, although both concatenation and \MSC\ models clearly perform well in regions of tree space with long branches and little incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), simulations reveal the erratic behavior of concatenation when subjected to data subsampling and its tendency to produce spuriously confident yet conflicting results in regions of parameter space where \MSC\ models still perform well. S&amp;G’s claims that \MSC\ models explain little or none (0–15%) of the observed gene tree heterogeneity observed in a mammal data set and that \MSC\ models assume \ILS\ as the only source of gene tree variation are flawed. Overall many of their criticisms of \MSC\ models are invalidated when concatenation is appropriately viewed as a special case of the MSC, which in turn is a special case of emerging network models in phylogenomics. We reiterate that there is enormous promise and value in recent implementations and tests of the \MSC\ and look forward to its increased use and refinement in phylogenomics.},

Several studies address questions of language relatedness, often challenging conventional assumptions about the status of language contact as an explanatory factor in accounting for linguistic similarities. Several address the question of Mainland Southeast Asia as a linguistic area, exploring new ways to imagine and define the boundaries, and indeed the boundedness, of a Mainland Southeast Asia area. Two contributions rethink the received notion of the 'sesquisyllable' with new empirical and theoretical angles. And a set of chapters explores topics in the morphology and syntax of the region's languages, sometimes challenging orthodox assumptions and claims about what a typical language of Mainland Southeast Asia is like. Written by leading researchers in the field, and with a substantial overview of current knowledge and new directions by the volume editors N. J. Enfield and Bernard Comrie, this book will serve as an authoritative source on where the linguistics of Mainland Southeast Asia is at, and where it is heading.},

    abstract = {Consonantal weakening has long been recognized as a significant, natural type of phonological change. Weakening can be defined as a systematic reduction process, often resulting in deletion, which affects certain consonants, depending on their position within the word or the phonological phrase. For example, weakening may include some or all of the following successive stages: voicing, spirantization, gliding, deletion, such as t&gt;d&gt;o&amp;#x030B;&gt;Ø (cf. Latin vita; Mod. French vie [vi]; Mod. Spanish vida [vio&amp;#x030B;a] ‘life’). My intent in this paper is to point out some interesting aspects of the mechanism of weakening, and more specifically to address myself to the issue of its representation in phonological theory. Within a transformational-generative framework, the ‘grammar change’ analysis (Halle 1962; Kiparsky 1968, 1971; King 1972) can superficially describe the formal progression of t&gt;d&gt;o&amp;#x030B;&gt;Ø in terms of a series of rule additions. However, such an analysis has no explanatory value whatsoever if the overall continuity of the weakening process is overlooked. In order to remedy the main inadequacies of the ‘grammar change’ analysis, I propose to incorporate a set of hierarchies into phonological theory. These hierarchies will represent the crucial phonological relationships which account for the systematic stages, the directionality and the scope of consonantal weakening. It will be argued that three types of information must be included, namely, reference to environmental factors, to manner of articulation and voicing properties, and to place of articulation features.},

    abstract = {This article tests earlier claims about the universality of patterns of polysemy and semantic extension in the domain of perception verbs. Utilizing data from a broad range (approx. 60) of Australian languages, we address two hypothesized universals. The first is Viberg's (1984) proposed unidirectional pattern of extension from higher to lower sensory modalities (i.e. INTRAFIELD extensions, like 'see' > 'hear'). The second hypothesized universal is that put forward by Sweetser (1990) regarding the extension of perception verbs to cognition readings (i.e. TRANSFIELD extensions, like 'see' > 'know'). She suggests that vision has primacy as the modality from which verbs of higher intellection, such as 'knowing' and 'thinking', are recruited, and proposes that verbs meaning 'hear' would not take on these readings, although they often extend to mean 'understand' or 'obey'. Though both hypotheses assign primacy to vision among the senses, the results of our Australian study show that Viberg's proposal remains intact, while Sweetser's is proved false. Australian languages recruit verbs of cognition like 'think' and 'know' from 'hear', but not from 'see'. It appears that, at least as far as perception verbs are concerned, transfield semantic changes are subject to greater cultural variability than intrafield semantic changes. We argue that the same semantic domain can have its UNIVERSAL and its RELATIVISTIC side, a foot in nature and a foot in culture, and conclude by demonstrating that there are good social and cultural reasons driving the extension of 'hearing', but not 'seeing', to 'know' and 'think' in Australian Aboriginal societies.},

    abstract = {<p>We present evidence that the geographic context in which a language is spoken may directly impact its phonological form. We examined the geographic coordinates and elevations of 567 language locations represented in a worldwide phonetic database. Languages with phonemic ejective consonants were found to occur closer to inhabitable regions of high elevation, when contrasted to languages without this class of sounds. In addition, the mean and median elevations of the locations of languages with ejectives were found to be comparatively high. The patterns uncovered surface on all major world landmasses, and are not the result of the influence of particular language families. They reflect a significant and positive worldwide correlation between elevation and the likelihood that a language employs ejective phonemes. In addition to documenting this correlation in detail, we offer two plausible motivations for its existence. We suggest that ejective sounds might be facilitated at higher elevations due to the associated decrease in ambient air pressure, which reduces the physiological effort required for the compression of air in the pharyngeal cavity–a unique articulatory component of ejective sounds. In addition, we hypothesize that ejective sounds may help to mitigate rates of water vapor loss through exhaled air. These explications demonstrate how a reduction of ambient air density could promote the usage of ejective phonemes in a given language. Our results reveal the direct influence of a geographic factor on the basic sound inventories of human languages.</p>},

    abstract = {This study offers evidence for an environmental effect on languages while relying on continuous linguistic and continuous ecological variables. Evidence is presented for a positive association between the typical ambient humidity of a language’s native locale and that language’s degree of reliance on vowels. The vowel-usage rates of over 4000 language varieties were obtained, and several methods were employed to test whether these usage rates are associated with ambient humidity. The results of these methods are generally consistent with the notion that reduced ambient humidity eventually yields a reduced reliance of languages on vowels, when compared to consonants. The analysis controls simultaneously for linguistic phylogeny and contact between languages. The results dovetail with previous work, based on binned data, suggesting that consonantal phonemes are more common in some ecologies. In addition to being based on continuous data and a larger data sample, however, these findings are tied to experimental research suggesting that dry air affects the behavior of the larynx by yielding increased phonatory effort. The results of this study are also consistent with previous work suggesting an interaction of aridity and tonality. The data presented here suggest that languages may evolve, like the communication systems of other species, in ways that are influenced subtly by ecological factors. It is stressed that more work is required, however, to explore this association and to establish a causal relationship between ambient air characteristics and the development of languages.},

It is shown that the problem is NP-complete. We then prove the existence of a partition of small total order in a sufficiently dense graph and devise an efficient algorithm to compute such a partition and the running time. Next, we define the notion of a compression of a graph G and use the result on graph partitioning to efficiently compute an optimal compression for graphs of a given size. An interesting application of the graph compression result arises from the fact that several graph algorithms can be adapted to work with the compressed representation of the input graph, thereby improving the bound on their running times, particularly on dense graphs. This makes use of the trade-off result we obtain from our partitioning algorithm. The algorithms analyzed include those for matchings, vertex connectivity, edge connectivity, and shortest paths. In each case, we improve upon the running times of the best-known algorithms for these problems.},

The details of the maximum likelihood method will depend on the details of the probabilistic model of evolution assumed. There are a very large number of possible models of evolution. For a few of the simpler models, the calculation of the likelihood of an evolutionary tree is outlined. For these models, the maximum likelihood tree will be the same as the "most parsimonious" (or minimum-steps) tree if the probability of change during the evolution of the group is assumed a priori to be very small. However, most sets of data require too many assumed state changes per character to be compatible with this assumption. Farris (1973) has argued that maximum likelihood and parsimony methods are identical under a much less restrictive set of assumptions. It is argued that the present methods are preferable to his, and a counterexample to his argument is presented. An algorithm which enables rapid calculation of the likelihood of a phylogeny is described.},

This paper proposes that these two notable OV orders in EAC are structurally distinct and that the structure of [wh V] is also different from that of [wh Neg/Aux V]. Furthermore, it is argued that Proto-Chinese is an SOV language and that the change from SOV (Proto-Chinese) to SVO (EAC) caused a stress shift from preverbal to postverbal position. According to the theory developed here, some problems that have remained in the syntax of Classical Chinese cease to exist, including the following: Why did the two OV structures remain in EAC? Why did the [wh-object V] order disappear later than the [Neg Pro-object V] order? Why did monosyllabic wh-words (e.g., he 'what') but not disyllabic wh-expressions (e.g., he-shi 'what thing') immediately precede the verb? And why was the disappearance of the [wh-object V] structure followed by a development of disyllabic wh-words (e.g., he wu 'what thing' &gt hewu 'what')? Each of these questions is answered in terms of prosody. The arguments made here claim that prosody is very important in resolving questions of how syntactic changes take place.},

The section begins with an introduction to one of the principal instruments of analysis, an approach that allows language to be viewed a complex adaptive system (CAS). Next the scope of the CAS approach is enlarged so that it incorporates the notion of cultural schemas and their heterogeneously distributed nature. Then, the role of serial metonymy in semantic innovation and change is examined. These conceptual tools are applied to the analysis of the Basque data and to the exploration of the factors that contributed to the development and structuring of the resulting semantic network, particularly, to new senses such as ‘fingers’ and ‘claws’. Finally, it is argued that this approach to modeling language and semantic change represents a powerful conceptual tool for researchers working in usage-based frameworks, and more specifically, for those investigating topics in the field of cognitive diachronic lexical semantics.},

    abstract = {Human brains flexibly combine the meanings of words to compose structured thoughts. For example, by combining the meanings of "bite," "dog," and "man," we can think about a dog biting a man, or a man biting a dog. Here, in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we identify a region of left mid-superior temporal cortex (lmSTC) that flexibly encodes "who did what to whom" in visually presented sentences. We find that lmSTC represents the current values of abstract semantic variables ("Who did it?" and "To whom was it done?") in distinct subregions. Experiment 1 first identifies a broad region of lmSTC whose activity patterns (i) facilitate decoding of structure-dependent sentence meaning ("Who did what to whom?") and (ii) predict affect-related amygdala responses that depend on this information (e.g., "the baby kicked the grandfather" vs. "the grandfather kicked the baby"). Experiment 2 then identifies distinct, but neighboring, subregions of lmSTC whose activity patterns carry information about the identity of the current "agent" ("Who did it?") and the current "patient" ("To whom was it done?"). These neighboring subregions lie along the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus and the lateral bank of the superior temporal gyrus, respectively. At a high level, these regions may function like topographically defined data registers, encoding the fluctuating values of abstract semantic variables. This functional architecture, which in key respects resembles that of a classical computer, may play a critical role in enabling humans to flexibly generate complex thoughts.},

    abstract = {To identify genetic changes underlying dog domestication and reconstruct their early evolutionary history, we generated high-quality genome sequences from three gray wolves, one from each of the three putative centers of dog domestication, two basal dog lineages (Basenji and Dingo) and a golden jackal as an outgroup. Analysis of these sequences supports a demographic model in which dogs and wolves diverged through a dynamic process involving population bottlenecks in both lineages and post-divergence gene flow. In dogs, the domestication bottleneck involved at least a 16-fold reduction in population size, a much more severe bottleneck than estimated previously. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon after their divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs arose was substantially larger than represented by modern wolf populations. We narrow the plausible range for the date of initial dog domestication to an interval spanning 11-16 thousand years ago, predating the rise of agriculture. In light of this finding, we expand upon previous work regarding the increase in copy number of the amylase gene (AMY2B) in dogs, which is believed to have aided digestion of starch in agricultural refuse. We find standing variation for amylase copy number variation in wolves and little or no copy number increase in the Dingo and Husky lineages. In conjunction with the estimated timing of dog origins, these results provide additional support to archaeological finds, suggesting the earliest dogs arose alongside hunter-gathers rather than agriculturists. Regarding the geographic origin of dogs, we find that, surprisingly, none of the extant wolf lineages from putative domestication centers is more closely related to dogs, and, instead, the sampled wolves form a sister monophyletic clade. This result, in combination with dog-wolf admixture during the process of domestication, suggests that a re-evaluation of past hypotheses regarding dog origins is necessary.},

    abstract = {Incongruence between gene trees is the main challenge faced by phylogeneticists in the genomic era. Incongruence can occur for artefactual reasons, when we fail to recover the correct gene trees, or for biological reasons, when true gene trees are actually distinct from each other, and from the species tree. Horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) between genomes are an important process of bacterial evolution resulting in a substantial amount of phylogenetic conflicts between gene trees. We argue that the (bacterial) species tree is still a meaningful scientific concept even in the case of HGTs, and that reconstructing it is still a valid goal. We tentatively assess the amount of phylogenetic incongruence caused by HGTs in bacteria by comparing bacterial datasets to a metazoan dataset in which transfers are presumably very scarce or absent. We review existing phylogenomic methods and their ability to return to the user, both the vertical (speciation/extinction history) and horizontal (gene transfers) phylogenetic signals.},

Based on these corpora, we construct 6 weighted and directed word co-occurrence networks. Besides all the networks exhibit scale-free and small-world features, we find several new non-trivial results, including connections among English words are denser, and the expression of English language is more flexible and powerful; the connection way among Spanish words is more stringent and this indicates that the Spanish grammar is more rigorous; values of many statistical parameters of the French and Spanish networks are very approximate and this shows that these two languages share many commonalities; Arabic and Russian words have many varieties, which result in rich types of words and a sparse connection among words; connections among Chinese words obey a more uniform distribution, and one inclines to use the least number of Chinese words to express the same complex information as those in other five languages. This shows that the expression of Chinese language is quite concise. In addition, several topics worth further investigating by the complex network approach have been observed in this study.},

A question that follows is, If culture is not influenced by genes, can it take any path? Employing a simple mathematical model of cultural transmission in which individuals may copy each others traits, it can be shown that cultural evolution favors individuals who are weakly influenced by others and able to influence others. The model suggests that the cultural evolution of rules of cultural transmission tends to create populations that evolve rapidly toward conservatism. Bias in cultural transmission may result purely from cultural dynamics. Freedom from genetic influence is not freedom to take any direction.},

    abstract = {Paracrine factors secreted by oocytes play a pivotal role in promoting early ovarian follicle growth and in defining a morphogenic gradient in antral follicles, yet the exact identities of these oocyte factors remain unknown. This study was conducted to determine the extent to which the mitogenic activity of mouse oocytes can be attributed to growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9). To do this, specific anti-human GDF9 monoclonal antibodies were generated. Based on epitope mapping and bioassays, a GDF9 neutralizing antibody, mAb-GDF9-53, was characterized with very low cross-reactivity with related transforming growth factor (TGF)beta superfamily members, including BMP15 (also called GDF9B). Pep-SPOT epitope mapping showed that mAb-GDF9-53 recognizes a short 4-aa sequence, and three-dimensional peptide modeling suggested that this binding motif lies at the C-terminal fingertip of mGDF9. As predicted by sequence alignments and modeling, the antibody detected recombinant GDF9, but not BMP15 in a Western blot and GDF9 protein in oocyte extract and oocyte-conditioned medium. In a mouse mural granulosa cell (MGC) bioassay, mAb-GDF9-53 completely abolished the mitogenic effects of GDF9, but had no effect on TGFbeta1 or activin A-stimulated MGC proliferation. An unrelated IgG at the same dose had no effect on GDF9 activity. This GDF9 neutralizing antibody was then tested in an established oocyte-secreted mitogen bioassay, where denuded oocytes cocultured with granulosa cells promote cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The mAb-GDF9-53 dose dependently (0-160 microg/ml) decreased the mitogenic activity of oocytes but only by approximately 45% at the maximum dose of mAb. Just 5 microg/ml of mAb-GDF9-53 neutralized 90% of recombinant mGDF9 mitogenic activity, but only 15% of oocyte activity. Unlike mAb-GDF9-53, a TGFbeta pan-specific neutralizing antibody did not affect the mitogenic capacity of the oocyte, but completely neutralized TGF beta 1-induced DNA synthesis. This study has characterized a specific GDF9 neutralizing antibody. Our data provide the first direct evidence that the endogenous GDF9 protein is an important oocyte-secreted mitogen, but also show that GDF9 accounts for only part of total oocyte bioactivity.},

The study of the prefix *s- has a long history and abundunt literature. This paper reviews past studies and presents the writer’s view from the perspective of the comparative study of Sino-Tibetan languages. The prefix *r- is proposed based on the reconstructions of *tr- and *tsr- in Old Chinese by Fang-kuei Li. The correspondences between Chinese and Tibeto-Burman reveal that *r- occurred before initial consonants and sometimes played the role of a prefix. The hypothesis of the prefix *N- in Old Chinese is put forward on the basis of Sino Tibetan comparison, in order to account for regular as well as irregular sound correspondences between Chinese and Tibetan, etymological relationships among Chinese words, Xie-sheng contacts in Chinese characters, and sound changes in Chinese as well as in Tibetan.},

    abstract = {Four algorithms, A–D, were developed to align two groups of biological sequences. Algorithm A is equivalent to the conventional dynamic programming method widely used for aligning ordinary sequences, whereas algorithms B – D are designed to evaluate the cost for a deletion/insertion more accurately when internal gaps are present in either or both groups of sequences. Rigorous optimization of the ‘sum of pairs’ (SP) score is achieved by algorithm D, whose average performance is close to O(MNL2) where M and N are numbers of sequences included in the two groups and L is the mean length of the sequences. Algorithm B uses some app mximations to cope with profile-based operations, whereas algorithm C is a simpler variant of algorithm D. These group-to-group alignment algorithms were applied to multiple sequence alignment with two iterative strategies: a progressive method based on a given binary tree and a randomized grouping-realignment method. The advantages and disadvantages of the four algorithms are discussed on the basis of the results of exatninations of several protein families.},

    abstract = {Adaptation has been defined and recognized by two different criteria: historical genesis (features built by natural selection for their present role) and current utility (features now enhancing fitness no matter how they arose). Biologists have often failed to recognize the potential confusion between these different definitions because we have tended to view natural selection as so dominant among evolutionary mechanisms that historical process and current product become one. Yet if many features of organisms are non-adapted, but available for useful cooptation in descendants, then an important concept has no name in our lexicon (and unnamed ideas generally remain unconsidered): features that now enhance fitness but were not built by natural selection for their current role. We propose that such features be called exaptations and that adaptation be restricted, as Darwin suggested, to features built by selection for their current role. We present several examples of exaptation, indicating where a failure to conceptualize such an idea limited the range of hypotheses previously available. We explore several consequences of exaptation and propose a terminological solution to the problem of preadaptation.},

    abstract = {<p>The island of New Guinea has the world’s highest linguistic diversity, with more than 900 languages divided into at least 23 distinct language families. This diversity includes the world’s third largest language family: Trans-New Guinea. However, the region is one of the world’s least well studied, and primary data is scattered across a wide range of publications and more often then not hidden in unpublished “gray” literature. The lack of primary research data on the New Guinea languages has been a major impediment to our understanding of these languages, and the history of the peoples in New Guinea. TransNewGuinea.org aims to collect data about these languages and place them online in a consistent format. This database will enable future research into the New Guinea languages with both traditional comparative linguistic methods and novel cutting-edge computational techniques. The long-term aim is to shed light into the prehistory of the peoples of New Guinea, and to understand why there is such major diversity in their languages.</p>},

The Bantu expansion that swept out of West Central Africa beginning âˆ¼5,000 y ago is one of the most influential cultural events of its kind, eventually spreading over a vast geographical area a new way of life in which farming played an increasingly important role. We use a new dated phylogeny of âˆ¼400 Bantu languages to show that migrating Bantu-speaking populations did not expand from their ancestral homeland in a "random walk" but, rather, followed emerging savannah corridors, with rainforest habitats repeatedly imposing temporal barriers to movement. When populations did move from savannah into rainforest, rates of migration were slowed, delaying the occupation of the rainforest by on average 300 y, compared with similar migratory movements exclusively within savannah or within rainforest by established rainforest populations. Despite unmatched abilities to produce innovations culturally, unfamiliar habitats significantly alter the route and pace of human dispersals.},

Alternative units for measuring word length are discussed with regard to their usability, as well as the influence that different kinds of material may have on studying word length. In addition to presenting some basic descriptive statistical characteristics, this contribution shows that word length is a substantial and central phenomenon for a comprehensive theory of language. It is shown, first, that the way in which words of a given length occur in linguistic material is not chaotic, but follows clearly defined, law-like regularities; and second, that word length is not an isolated category within the linguistic system, but is closely interrelated to other properties of the word, as well as of other linguistic units, levels, and structures. Theoretical models are discussed, concerning not only these interrelations, but sequential text analysis and frequency distributions.},

The statistical properties of speech appear to be particularly well matched to the auditory neural code. However, only English has so far been analyzed from an efficient coding perspective. It thus remains unknown whether such an approach is able to capture differences between the sound patterns of different languages. Here, we use independent component analysis to derive information theoretically optimal, non-redundant codes (filter populations) for seven typologically distinct languages (Dutch, English, Japanese, Marathi, Polish, Spanish and Turkish) and relate the statistical properties of these filter populations to documented differences in the speech rhythms (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Analysis 1</xref>) and consonant inventories (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Analysis 2</xref>) of these languages. We show that consonant class membership plays a particularly important role in shaping the statistical structure of speech in different languages, suggesting that acoustic transience, a property that discriminates consonant classes from one another, is highly relevant for efficient coding.</p>},

    abstract = {Over the history of mankind, textual records change. Sometimes due to mistakes during transcription, sometimes on purpose, as a way to rewrite facts and reinterpret history. There are several classical cases, such as the logarithmic tables, and the transmission of antique and medieval scholarship. Today, text documents are largely edited and redistributed on the Web. Articles on news portals and collaborative platforms (such as Wikipedia), source code, posts on social networks, and even scientific publications or literary works are some examples in which textual content can be subject to changes in an evolutionary process. In this scenario, given a set of near-duplicate documents, it is worthwhile to find which one is the original and the history of changes that created the whole set. Such functionality would have immediate applications on news tracking services, detection of plagiarism, textual criticism, and copyright enforcement, for instance. However, this is not an easy task, as textual features pointing to the documents’ evolutionary direction may not be evident and are often dataset dependent. Moreover, side information, such as time stamps, are neither always available nor reliable. In this paper, we propose a framework for reliably reconstructing text phylogeny trees, and seamlessly exploring new approaches on a wide range of scenarios of text reusage. We employ and evaluate distinct combinations of dissimilarity measures and reconstruction strategies within the proposed framework, and evaluate each approach with extensive experiments, including a set of artificial near-duplicate documents with known phylogeny, and from documents collected from Wikipedia, whose modifications were made by Internet users. We also present results from qualitative experiments in two different applications: text plagiarism and reconstruction of evolutionary trees for manuscripts (stemmatology).},

    year = {2003},
    abstract = {A phylogenetic network is a generalization of a phylogenetic tree, allowing structural properties that are not tree-like. With the growth of genomic data, much of which does not fit ideal tree models, there is greater need to understand the algorithmics and combinatorics of phylogenetic networks [10, 11]. However, to date, very little has been published on this, with the notable exception of the paper by Wang et al.[12]. Other related papers include [4, 5, 7] We consider the problem introduced in [12], of determining whether the sequences can be derived on a phylogenetic network where the recombination cycles are node disjoint. In this paper, we call such a phylogenetic network a "galled-tree". By more deeply analysing the combinatorial constraints on cycle-disjoint phylogenetic networks, we obtain an efficient algorithm that is guaranteed to be both a necessary and sufficient test for the existence of a galled-tree for the data. If there is a galled-tree, the algorithm constructs one and obtains an implicit representation of all the galled trees for the data, and can create these in linear time for each one. We also note two additional results related to galled trees: first, any set of sequences that can be derived on a galled tree can be derived on a true tree (without recombination cycles), where at most one back mutation is allowed per site; second, the site compatibility problem (which is NP-hard in general) can be solved in linear time for any set of sequences that can be derived on a galled tree. The combinatorial constraints we develop apply (for the most part) to node-disjoint cycles in any phylogenetic network (not just galled-trees), and can be used for example to prove that a given site cannot be on a node-disjoint cycle in any phylogenetic network. Perhaps more important than the specific results about galled-trees, we introduce an approach that can be used to study recombination in phylogenetic networks that go beyond galled-trees.},

    abstract = {We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ∼8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ∼24,000-year-old Siberian. By ∼6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact ∼4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced ∼75% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least ∼3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.},

    abstract = {Defining homologous genes is important in many evolutionary studies but raises obvious issues. Some of these issues are conceptual and stem from our assumptions of how a gene evolves, others are practical, and depend on the algorithmic decisions implemented in existing software. Therefore, to make progress in the study of homology, both ontological and epistemological questions must be considered. In particular, defining homologous genes cannot be solely addressed under the classic assumptions of strong tree thinking, according to which genes evolve in a strictly tree-like fashion of vertical descent and divergence and the problems of homology detection are primarily methodological. Gene homology could also be considered under a different perspective where genes evolve as "public goods," subjected to various introgressive processes. In this latter case, defining homologous genes becomes a matter of designing models suited to the actual complexity of the data and how such complexity arises, rather than trying to fit genetic data to some a priori tree-like evolutionary model, a practice that inevitably results in the loss of much information. Here we show how important aspects of the problems raised by homology detection methods can be overcome when even more fundamental roots of these problems are addressed by analyzing public goods thinking evolutionary processes through which genes have frequently originated. This kind of thinking acknowledges distinct types of homologs, characterized by distinct patterns, in phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic unrooted or multirooted networks. In addition, we define "family resemblances" to include genes that are related through intermediate relatives, thereby placing notions of homology in the broader context of evolutionary relationships. We conclude by presenting some payoffs of adopting such a pluralistic account of homology and family relationship, which expands the scope of evolutionary analyses beyond the traditional, yet relatively narrow focus allowed by a strong tree-thinking view on gene evolution.},

    abstract = {Increasingly, similarity networks are being used for evolutionary analyses of molecular datasets. These networks are very useful, in particular for the analysis of gene sharing, lateral gene transfer and for the detection of distant homologs. Currently, such analyses require some computer programming skills due to the limited availability of user-friendly freely distributed software. Consequently, although appealing, the construction and analyses of these networks remain less familiar to biologists than do phylogenetic approaches.\\ In order to ease the use of similarity networks in the community of evolutionary biologists, we introduce a software program, EGN, that runs under Linux or MacOSX. EGN automates the reconstruction of gene and genome networks from nucleic and proteic sequences. EGN also implements statistics describing genetic diversity in these samples, for various user-defined thresholds of similarities. In the interest of studying the complexity of evolutionary processes affecting microbial evolution, we applied EGN to a dataset of 571,044 proteic sequences from the three domains of life and from mobile elements. We observed that, in Borrelia, plasmids play a different role than in most other eubacteria. Rather than being genetic couriers involved in lateral gene transfer, Borrelia's plasmids and their genes act as private genetic goods, that contribute to the creation of genetic diversity within their parasitic hosts.\\ EGN can be used for constructing, analyzing, and mining molecular datasets in evolutionary studies. The program can help increase our knowledge of the processes through which genes from distinct sources and/or from multiple genomes co-evolve in lineages of cellular organisms.},

    abstract = {In 1955 and 1956, the authors and others were able to investigate the Ainu dialects, which were on the point of dying out. Some of the informants were the last surviving speaker or speakers of the dialects, and all of them were very old people. Some of them even have died since our investigation. In this article, we present the lexicostatistic data of 19 dialects, of which 13 are those of Hokkaido and 6 are those of Sakhalin. All the field work was done in Hokkaido. Some informants spoke Ainu fluently, but others spoke imperfectly and were unable to remember several words. In §4 (Table I on p.37∿p.59), the Ainu words are arranged according to Swadesh's 200 item list. In §5 (cf. Table II inserted), cognate residues are marked with +; non-cognates with -; cognates and non-cognates with±(when one or both of the dialects have two forms, and the inperfectness of the record does not allow us to decide which is more basic); questionable etymology or choice with ○; doubtful record with?; no answer given with・; lacuna of record with ( ). On Table II, all + have been omitted, except for ±. In §6, problematic points in the computation of residues are discussed. In §7 (Table III and Fig.2), the percentages of the residual cognates are shown in figures and graphs. In §8, the significance of the figures on Table III (Fig.2) is discussed. It is pointed out among other things that there is a remarkable gap between Hokkaido dialects and those of Sakhalin, Soya, the northernmost of Hokkaido, being the closest to the Sakhalin dialects. A significant gap is also seen between Samani on the one hand, and Niikappu, Hiratori, and Nukkibetsu on the other, which coincides with the discrepancies in other culture and customs, etc. In §9, the data on Table I are examined from the view-point of linguistic geography. In §10, questions concerning the computation of time-depth are referred to. In §11, the items, with regard to which the Hokkaido and Sakhalin dialects diverge from each other, are compared with those with regard to which the Ryukyuan and the Japanese dialects diverge from each other. It is found that the only common item in the two lists is 47. knee. Thus, it is possible to state that Ainu and Japanese have had the tendency to change in different directions, in so far as the 200 item list is concerned. In §12, it is pointed out that Japanese loanwords in Ainu and Chinese loan-words in Japanese are very few in so far as the list is concerned. Hattori does not think it impossible that the root √<kur> of Ainu and the forms of Japanese, Korean, Tunguse, and Turkic (on p.66) are cognates from the possible parent language of all these languages. It is hoped to promote comparative study of this kind.},

    abstract = {Understanding the evolution of language requires evidence regarding origins and processes that led to change. In the last 40 years, there has been an explosion of research on this problem as well as a sense that considerable progress has been made. We argue instead that the richness of ideas is accompanied by a poverty of evidence, with essentially no explanation of how and why our linguistic computations and representations evolved. We show that, to date, (1) studies of nonhuman animals provide virtually no relevant parallels to human linguistic communication, and none to the underlying biological capacity; (2) the fossil and archaeological evidence does not inform our understanding of the computations and representations of our earliest ancestors, leaving details of origins and selective pressure unresolved; (3) our understanding of the genetics of language is so impoverished that there is little hope of connecting genes to linguistic processes any time soon; (4) all modeling attempts have made unfounded assumptions, and have provided no empirical tests, thus leaving any insights into language's origins unverifiable. Based on the current state of evidence, we submit that the most fundamental questions about the origins and evolution of our linguistic capacity remain as mysterious as ever, with considerable uncertainty about the discovery of either relevant or conclusive evidence that can adjudicate among the many open hypotheses. We conclude by presenting some suggestions about possible paths forward.},

However in reality speciation may occur over an extended period of time, during which sister lineages remain in partial contact. Inference of multispecies phylogenies under those conditions is difficult. Indeed even designing simulators which correctly sample gene histories under these conditions is non-trivial.},

A similar discussion among linguists has barely begun, but the present results suggest that there is also room for controversy over this issue in linguistics. The only previous study correlated the number of nodes in linguistic phylogenies with branch lengths and found support for punctuated equilibrium. We replicate this result for branch lengths but find no support for punctuated equilibrium using a different, automated measure of linguistic divergence and a much larger dataset. With the automated measure, segments of trees containing more nodes show no greater divergence from an outgroup than segments containing fewer nodes.},

    abstract = {The Freiburg speech intelligibility test according to DIN 45621 was introduced around 60 years ago. For decades, and still today, the Freiburg test has been a standard whose relevance extends far beyond pure audiometry. It is used primarily to determine the speech perception threshold (based on two-digit numbers) and the ability to discriminate speech at suprathreshold presentation levels (based on monosyllabic nouns). Moreover, it is a measure of the degree of disability, the requirement for and success of technical hearing aids (auxiliaries directives), and the compensation for disability and handicap (Königstein recommendation). In differential audiological diagnostics, the Freiburg test contributes to the distinction between low- and high-frequency hearing loss, as well as to identification of conductive, sensory, neural, and central disorders. Currently, the phonemic and perceptual balance of the monosyllabic test lists is subject to critical discussions. Obvious deficiencies exist for testing speech recognition in noise. In this respect, alternatives such as sentence or rhyme tests in closed-answer inventories are discussed.},

Grounded on Chung's (1996) autosegmental model, the current analysis is characterized by six points: (a) Every syllable has an XXX template. (b) Edge-in (Yip 1988) takes care of the association of edge consonants with edge skeletal slots. (c) The realization of the nucleus abides by the order of N-placement, rising diphthong formation, and falling diphthong formation. (d) The sonority hierarchy of a &gt ɔ &gt e &gt o &gt i &gt u determines how vocoids are associated with the nucleus position. If there is a tie, the first segment gets linked by temporal sequence. V-neutralization (Chung 1996) turns mid vowels into high when they form rimes with the adjacent vowels. (e) The contracted form abides by Maximality (Prince 1985) to construct the largest possible syllable. (f) In addition, stress is shown irrelevant, and phonotactic constraints may be contravened.},

Based on the knowledge of a multi-labelled tree relating collection of polyploids, we present a canonical construction of a phylogenetic network that exhibits the tree.

Mapping characters on trees allows the nature, number, and timing of the transformations to be identified. The parsimony method is the only method available for mapping morphological characters on phylogenies. Although the parsimony method often makes reasonable reconstructions of the history of a character, it has a number of limitations. These limitations include the inability to consider more than a single change along a branch on a tree and the uncoupling of evolutionary time from amount of character change. We extended a method described by Nielsen (2002, Syst. Biol. 51:729-739) to the mapping of morphological characters under continuous-time Markov models and demonstrate here the utility of the method for mapping characters on trees and for identifying character correlation.},

    abstract = {Hull, David L. (Department of Philosophy, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201) 1976. Are species really individuals? Syst. Zool. 25:174–191.—The processes which contribute to the evolution of biological species take place at a variety of levels of organization; e.g., genes give rise to other genes, organisms give rise to other organisms, and species give rise to other species. All of these processes require continuity through descent. If species are to be units of evolution, they need not be composed of similar organisms; instead they must be made up of organisms related by descent. Taxonomists do not impose this requirement on the phenomena; rather it follows from the nature of the evolutionary process itself. In addition to spatiotemporal continuity, species must also possess a certain degree of unity to function as units of evolution. Gene exchange is one means by which such unity can be promoted. The mechanisms by which asexual species maintain a similar unity are problematic; higher taxa pose an even more serious problem. However, if species are chunks of the genealogical nexus, they cannot be viewed as classes. Instead they possess all the characteristics of individuals—that is, if organisms are taken to be paradigm individuals. The major difference between organisms and species as individuals is that organisms possess a largely fixed genetic makeup which constrains their development, whereas species do not. If species are individuals, then their names are most naturally viewed as proper names, names which denote particular individuals but do not possess any intensional meaning.},

    abstract = {<sec><title>Background</title><p>Many technological, biological, social, and information networks fall into the broad class of ‘small-world’ networks: they have tightly interconnected clusters of nodes, and a shortest mean path length that is similar to a matched random graph (same number of nodes and edges). This semi-quantitative definition leads to a categorical distinction (‘small/not-small’) rather than a quantitative, continuous grading of networks, and can lead to uncertainty about a network's small-world status. Moreover, systems described by small-world networks are often studied using an equivalent canonical network model – the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model. However, the process of establishing an equivalent WS model is imprecise and there is a pressing need to discover ways in which this equivalence may be quantified.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We defined a precise measure of ‘small-world-ness’ <italic>S</italic> based on the trade off between high local clustering and short path length. A network is now deemed a ‘small-world’ if <italic>S</italic>&gt;1 - an assertion which may be tested statistically. We then examined the behavior of <italic>S</italic> on a large data-set of real-world systems. We found that all these systems were linked by a linear relationship between their <italic>S</italic> values and the network size <italic>n</italic>. Moreover, we show a method for assigning a unique Watts-Strogatz (WS) model to any real-world network, and show analytically that the WS models associated with our sample of networks also show linearity between <italic>S</italic> and <italic>n</italic>. Linearity between <italic>S</italic> and <italic>n</italic> is not, however, inevitable, and neither is <italic>S</italic> maximal for an arbitrary network of given size. Linearity may, however, be explained by a common limiting growth process.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We have shown how the notion of a small-world network may be quantified.

While it is generally undisputed that bifurcating speciation events and descent with modifications are major forces of evolution, there is a growing belief that reticulate events also have a role to play. Phylogenetic networks provide an alternative to phylogenetic trees and may be more suitable for datasets where evolution involves significant amounts of reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer or recombination.

Institutional arrangements have reflected the varying degrees of kinship, kithship, and separation.

    abstract = {Gene fusion is an important evolutionary process. It can yield valuable information to infer the interactions and functions of proteins. Fused genes have been identified as non-transitive patterns of similarity in triplets of genes. To be computationally tractable, this approach usually imposes an a priori distinction between a dataset in which fused genes are searched for, and a dataset that may have provided genetic material for fusion. This reduces the 'genetic space' in which fusion can be discovered, as only a subset of triplets of genes is investigated. Moreover, this approach may have a high-false-positive rate, and it does not identify gene families descending from a common fusion event.\\ We represent similarities between sequences as a network. This leads to an efficient formulation of previous methods of fused gene identification, which we implemented in the Python program FusedTriplets. Furthermore, we propose a new characterization of families of fused genes, as clique minimal separators of the sequence similarity network. This well-studied graph topology provides a robust and fast method of detection, well suited for automatic analyses of big datasets. We implemented this method in the C++ program MosaicFinder, which additionally uses local alignments to discard false-positive candidates and indicates potential fusion points. The grouping into families will help distinguish sequencing or prediction errors from real biological fusions, and it will yield additional insight into the function and history of fused genes.\\ FusedTriplets and MosaicFinder are published under the GPL license and are freely available with their source code at this address: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mosaicfinder.\\ Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we present an approach that takes lexical data taken from a large collection of publicly available wordlists as input and infers automatic assessments regarding the cognacy of words and sounds. We illustrate the workflow and test it by comparing the results obtained from the computation of Maximum Likelihood trees with those provided by experts. The results show that our workflow still lags behind simpler approaches which analyze the data within a distance-based framework. However, since distance-based analyses bear a blackbox character, not allowing for a rigorous check of the individual decisions which lead to a certain classification proposal, we think that our experiments are an important contribution towards the establishment of more transparent methods in quantitative historical linguistics.},

Methods for ancestral state reconstruction have only been applied sporadically. In contrast to phylogenetic algorithms, automatic reconstruction methods presuppose phylogenetic information in order to explain what has evolved when and where. Here we report a pilot study exploring how well automatic methods for ancestral state reconstruction perform in the task of onomasiological reconstruction in multilingual word lists, where algorithms are used to infer how the words evolved along a given phylogeny, and reconstruct which cognate classes were used to express a given meaning in the ancestral languages. Comparing three different methods, Maximum Parsimony, Minimal Lateral Networks, and Maximum Likelihood on three different test sets (Indo-European, Austronesian, Chinese) using binary and multi-state coding of the data as well as single and sampled phylogenies, we find that Maximum Likelihood largely outperforms the other methods. At the same time, however, the general performance was disappointingly low, ranging between 0.66 (Chinese) and 0.79 (Austronesian) for the F-Scores. A closer linguistic evaluation of the reconstructions proposed by the best method and the reconstructions given in the gold standards revealed that the majority of the cases where the algorithms failed can be attributed to problems of independent semantic shift (homoplasy), to morphological processes in lexical change, and to wrong reconstructions in the independently created test sets that we employed.},

    abstract = {The general Markov model (GMM) of nucleotide substitution does not assume the evolutionary process to be stationary, reversible, or homogeneous. The GMM can be simplified by assuming the evolutionary process to be stationary. A stationary GMM is appropriate for analyses of phylogenetic data sets that are compositionally homogeneous; a data set is considered to be compositionally homogeneous if a statistical test does not detect significant differences in the marginal distributions of the sequences. Though the general time-reversible (GTR) model assumes stationarity, it also assumes reversibility and homogeneity. We propose two new stationary and nonhomogeneous models-one constrains the GMM to be reversible, whereas the other does not. The two models, coupled with the GTR model, comprise a set of nested models that can be used to test the assumptions of reversibility and homogeneity for stationary processes. The two models are extended to incorporate invariable sites and used to analyze a seven-taxon hominoid data set that displays compositional homogeneity. We show that within the class of stationary models, a nonhomogeneous model fits the hominoid data better than the GTR model. We note that if one considers a wider set of models that are not constrained to be stationary, then an even better fit can be obtained for the hominoid data. However, the methods for reducing model complexity from an extremely large set of nonstationary models are yet to be developed.},

Owing to the large number of Markov models that can be used for data analysis, model selection is a combinatorial problem that cannot be solved by performing an exhaustive search of all possible models. Currently, model selection is based on a small subset of the available Markov models, namely those that assume the evolutionary process to be globally stationary, reversible, and homogeneous. This forces the optimal model to be time reversible even though the actual data may not satisfy these assumptions. This problem can be alleviated by including more complex models during the model selection. We present a novel heuristic that evaluates a small fraction of these complex models and identifies the optimal model.},

    volume = {9},

    year = {2008},
    abstract = {Tone languages such as Thai and Mandarin Chinese use differences in fundamental frequency (F0, pitch) to distinguish lexical meaning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that native speakers of a non-tone language have difficulty discriminating among tone contrasts and are sensitive to different F0 dimensions than speakers of a tone language. The aim of the present ERP study was to investigate the effect of language background and training on the non-attentive processing of lexical tones. EEG was recorded from 12 adult native speakers of Mandarin Chinese, 12 native speakers of American English, and 11 Thai speakers while they were watching a movie and were presented with multiple tokens of low-falling, mid-level and high-rising Thai lexical tones. High-rising or low-falling tokens were presented as deviants among mid-level standard tokens, and vice versa. EEG data and data from a behavioral discrimination task were collected before and after a two-day perceptual categorization training task.\\ Behavioral discrimination improved after training in both the Chinese and the English groups. Low-falling tone deviants versus standards elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN) in all language groups. Before, but not after training, the English speakers showed a larger MMN compared to the Chinese, even though English speakers performed worst in the behavioral tasks. The MMN was followed by a late negativity, which became smaller with improved discrimination. The High-rising deviants versus standards elicited a late negativity, which was left-lateralized only in the English and Chinese groups.\\ Results showed that native speakers of English, Chinese and Thai recruited largely similar mechanisms when non-attentively processing Thai lexical tones. However, native Thai speakers differed from the Chinese and English speakers with respect to the processing of late F0 contour differences (high-rising versus mid-level tones). In addition, native speakers of a non-tone language (English) were initially more sensitive to F0 onset differences (low-falling versus mid-level contrast), which was suppressed as a result of training. This result converges with results from previous behavioral studies and supports the view that attentive as well as non-attentive processing of F0 contrasts is affected by language background, but is malleable even in adult learners.},

    abstract = {<p>Words are built from smaller meaning bearing parts, called morphemes. As one word can contain multiple morphemes, one morpheme can be present in different words. The number of distinct words a morpheme can be found in is its family size. Here we used Birth-Death-Innovation Models (BDIMs) to analyze the distribution of morpheme family sizes in English and German vocabulary over the last 200 years. Rather than just fitting to a probability distribution, these mechanistic models allow for the direct interpretation of identified parameters. Despite the complexity of language change, we indeed found that a specific variant of this pure stochastic model, the second order linear balanced BDIM, significantly fitted the observed distributions. In this model, birth and death rates are increased for smaller morpheme families. This finding indicates an influence of morpheme family sizes on vocabulary changes. This could be an effect of word formation, perception or both. On a more general level, we give an example on how mechanistic models can enable the identification of statistical trends in language change usually hidden by cultural influences.</p>},

This database, called the British Lexicon Project (BLP), fills an important gap between the Dutch Lexicon Project (DLP; Keuleers, Diependaele, & Brysbaert, Frontiers in Language Sciences. Psychology, 1, 174, 2010) and the English Lexicon Project (ELP; Balota et al., 2007), because it applies the repeated measures design of the DLP to the English language. The high correlation between the BLP and ELP data indicates that a high percentage of variance in lexical decision data sets is systematic variance, rather than noise, and that the results of megastudies are rather robust with respect to the selection and presentation of the stimuli. Because of its design, the BLP makes the same analyses possible as the DLP, offering researchers with a new interesting data set of word-processing times for mixed effects analyses and mathematical modeling. The BLP data are available at http://crr.ugent.be/blp and as Electronic Supplementary Materials.},

After an introductory chapter, the grammar deals with phonology, word classes, the noun phrase, possession, the verb phrase, verbal and nonverbal clauses, mood and negation, and clause combinations. The phonology of Rapa Nui reveals certain issues of typological interest, such as the existence of strict conditions on the phonological shape of words, word-final devoicing, and reduplication patterns motivated by metrical constraints. For Polynesian languages, the distinction between nouns and verbs in the lexicon has often been denied; in this grammar it is argued that this distinction is needed for Rapa Nui. Rapa Nui has sometimes been characterised as an ergative language; this grammar shows that it is unambiguously accusative. Subject and object marking depend on an interplay of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors. Other distinctive features of the language include the existence of a ‘neutral’ aspect marker, a serial verb construction, the emergence of copula verbs, a possessive-relative construction, and a tendency to maximise the use of the nominal domain. Rapa Nui’s relationship to the other Polynesian languages is a recurring theme in this grammar; the relationship to Tahitian (which has profoundly influenced Rapa Nui) especially deserves attention.

    abstract = {This paper presents an extension of Baxter & Manaster-Ramer’s (2000) approach to the problem of false cognates in the determination of relationships between languages. Their approach uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate how many lexical similarities we can expect to be due to chance between two lexical lists from different languages, and consequently how many are too many to be all false cognates. Although very efficient, their model has the shortcoming of being applicable only to simple lexical lists such as the Swadesh list, with one-to-one semantic correspondences between the individual terms. Here I present a new model that can be applied to any kind of word list, and can include comparisons between multiple terms sharing the same semantic field. After a theoretical description, a controlled test and a contra-test, I finally apply the method to a real test case, investigating the probability of relation between Pre-Greek, the non‐Indo-European substrate of classical Greek, and Proto-Basque, Proto-Uralic and ‘Proto-Altaic’.},

    abstract = {From the foods we eat and the houses we construct, to our religious practices and political organization, to who we can marry and the types of games we teach our children, the diversity of cultural practices in the world is astounding. Yet, our ability to visualize and understand this diversity is limited by the ways it has been documented and shared: on a culture-by-culture basis, in locally-told stories or difficult-to-access repositories. In this paper we introduce D-PLACE, the Database of Places, Language, Culture, and Environment. This expandable and open-access database (accessible at https://d-place.org) brings together a dispersed corpus of information on the geography, language, culture, and environment of over 1400 human societies. We aim to enable researchers to investigate the extent to which patterns in cultural diversity are shaped by different forces, including shared history, demographics, migration/diffusion, cultural innovations, and environmental and ecological conditions. We detail how D-PLACE helps to overcome four common barriers to understanding these forces: i) location of relevant cultural data, (ii) linking data from distinct sources using diverse ethnonyms, (iii) variable time and place foci for data, and (iv) spatial and historical dependencies among cultural groups that present challenges for analysis. D-PLACE facilitates the visualisation of relationships among cultural groups and between people and their environments, with results downloadable as tables, on a map, or on a linguistic tree. We also describe how D-PLACE can be used for exploratory, predictive, and evolutionary analyses of cultural diversity by a range of users, from members of the worldwide public interested in contrasting their own cultural practices with those of other societies, to researchers using large-scale computational phylogenetic analyses to study cultural evolution. In summary, we hope that D-PLACE will enable new lines of investigation into the major drivers of cultural change and global patterns of cultural diversity.},

The origin of Semitic and the nature of dispersals by Semitic-speaking populations are of great importance to our understanding of the ancient history of the Middle East and Horn of Africa. Semitic populations are associated with the oldest written languages and urban civilizations in the region, which gave rise to some of the world's first major religious and literary traditions. In this study, we employ Bayesian computational phylogenetic techniques recently developed in evolutionary biology to analyse Semitic lexical data by modelling language evolution and explicitly testing alternative hypotheses of Semitic history. We implement a relaxed linguistic clock to date language divergences and use epigraphic evidence for the sampling dates of extinct Semitic languages to calibrate the rate of language evolution. Our statistical tests of alternative Semitic histories support an initial divergence of Akkadian from ancestral Semitic over competing hypotheses (e.g. an African origin of Semitic). We estimate an Early Bronze Age origin for Semitic approximately 5750 years ago in the Levant, and further propose that contemporary Ethiosemitic languages of Africa reflect a single introduction of early Ethiosemitic from southern Arabia approximately 2800 years ago.},

    abstract = {Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is an important mechanism of natural variation among prokaryotes. Over the full course of evolution, most or all of the genes resident in a given prokaryotic genome have been affected by LGT, yet the frequency of LGT can vary greatly across genes and across prokaryotic groups. The proteobacteria are among the most diverse of prokaryotic taxa. The prevalence of LGT in their genome evolution calls for the application of network-based methods instead of tree-based methods to investigate the relationships among these species. Here, we report networks that capture both vertical and horizontal components of evolutionary history among 1,207,272 proteins distributed across 329 sequenced proteobacterial genomes. The network of shared proteins reveals modularity structure that does not correspond to current classification schemes. On the basis of shared protein-coding genes, the five classes of proteobacteria fall into two main modules, one including the alpha-, delta-, and epsilonproteobacteria and the other including beta- and gammaproteobacteria. The first module is stable over different protein identity thresholds. The second shows more plasticity with regard to the sequence conservation of proteins sampled, with the gammaproteobacteria showing the most chameleon-like evolutionary characteristics within the present sample. Using a minimal lateral network approach, we compared LGT rates at different phylogenetic depths. In general, gene evolution by LGT within proteobacteria is very common. At least one LGT event was inferred to have occurred in at least 75% of the protein families. The average LGT rate at the species and class depth is about one LGT event per protein family, the rate doubling at the phylum level to an average of two LGT events per protein family. Hence, our results indicate that the rate of gene acquisition per protein family is similar at the level of species (by recombination) and at the level of classes (by LGT). The frequency of LGT per genome strongly depends on the species lifestyle, with endosymbionts showing far lower LGT frequencies than free-living species. Moreover, the nature of the transferred genes suggests that gene transfer in proteobacteria is frequently mediated by conjugation.},

    abstract = {Directional evolution has played an important role in shaping the morphological, ecological and molecular diversity of life. However, standard substitution models assume stationarity of the evolutionary process over the time scale examined, thus hampering the study of directionality. Here we explore a simple, non-stationary model of evolution for discrete data, which assumes that the state frequencies at the root differ from the equilibrium frequencies of the homogeneous evolutionary process along the rest of the tree (i.e., the process is non-stationary, non-reversible, but homogeneous). Within this framework, we develop a Bayesian approach for testing directional versus stationary evolution using a reversible-jump algorithm. Simulations show that when only data from extant taxa is available, the success in inferring directionality is strongly dependent on the evolutionary rate, the shape of the tree, the relative branch lengths, and the number of taxa. Given suitable evolutionary rates (0.1 to 0.5 expected substitutions between root and tips), accounting for directionality improves tree inference and often allows correct rooting of the tree without the use of an outgroup. As an empirical test, we apply our method to study directional evolution in hymenopteran morphology. We focus on three character systems: wing veins, muscles, and sclerites. We find strong support for a trend towards loss of wing veins and muscles, while stationarity cannot be ruled out for sclerites. Adding fossil and time information in a total-evidence dating approach, we show that accounting for directionality results in more precise estimates not only of the ancestral state at the root of the tree, but also of the divergence times. Our model relaxes the assumption of stationarity and reversibility by adding a minimum of additional parameters, and is thus well suited to studying the nature of the evolutionary process in datasets of limited size, such as morphology.},

    abstract = {Regular correspondences between historically related languages can be modelled using finite- state transducers (FST). A new method is presented by demonstrating it with a bidirectional experiment between Finnish and Estonian. An artificial representation (resembling a proto- language) is established between two related languages. This representation, AFE (Aligned Finnish-Estonian) is based on the letter by letter alignment of the two languages and uses mechanically constructed morphophonemes which represent the corresponding characters. By describing the constraints of this AFE using two-level rules, one may construct useful mappings between the languages. In this way, the badly ambiguous FSTs from Finnish and Estonian to AFE can be composed into a practically unambiguous transducer from Finnish to Estonian. The inverse mapping from Estonian to Finnish is mildly ambiguous. Steps according to the proposed method could be repeated as such with dialectal or older written texts. Choosing a set of model words, aligning them, recording the mechanical correspondences and designing rules for the constraints could be done with a limited effort. For the purposes of indexing and searching, the mild ambiguity may be tolerable as such. The ambiguity can be further reduced by composing the resulting FST with a speller or morphological analyser of the standard language.},

    abstract = {Background Tardigrades are meiofaunal ecdysozoans that may be key to understanding the origins of Arthropoda. Many species of Tardigrada can survive extreme conditions through adoption of a cryptobiotic state. A recent high profile paper suggested that the genome of a model tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini, has been shaped by unprecedented levels of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) encompassing 17\% of protein coding genes, and speculated that this was likely formative in the evolution of stress resistance. We tested these findings using an independently sequenced and assembled genome of H. dujardini, derived from the same original culture isolate. Results Whole-organism sampling of meiofaunal species will perforce include gut and surface microbiotal contamination, and our raw data contained bacterial and algal sequences. Careful filtering generated a cleaned H. dujardini genome assembly, validated and annotated with GSSs, ESTs and RNA-Seq data, with superior assembly metrics compared to the published, HGT-rich assembly. A small amount of additional microbial contamination likely remains in our 135 Mb assembly. Our assembly length fits well with multiple empirical measurements of H. dujardini genome size, and is 120 Mb shorter than the HGT-rich version. Among 23,021 protein coding gene predictions we found 216 genes (0.9\%) with similarity to prokaryotes, 196 of which were expressed, suggestive of HGT. We also identified ~400 genes (&lt;2\%) that could be HGT from other non-metazoan eukaryotes. Cross-comparison of the assemblies, using raw read and RNA-Seq data, confirmed that the overwhelming majority of the putative HGT candidates in the previous genome were predicted from scaffolds at very low coverage and were not transcribed. Crucially much of the natural contamination in both projects was non-overlapping, confirming it as foreign to the shared target animal genome. Conclusions We find no support for massive horizontal gene transfer into the genome of H. dujardini. Many of the bacterial sequences in the previously published genome were not present in our raw reads. In construction of our assembly we removed most, but still not all, contamination with approaches derived from metagenomics, which we show are very appropriate for meiofaunal species. We conclude that HGT into H. dujardini accounts for 1-2\% of genes and that the proposal that 17\% of tardigrade genes originate from HGT events is an artefact of undetected contamination.},

The purpose of this paper is to show that theories of unilinear descent in biology, linguistics and anthropology represent just one among several approaches in explain evolutionary development in all three realms. ?Antidotes? to the pedigree and tree of life metaphors have been presented as early as phylogenetic models, but have been often neglected, surpressed or simply been ignored.

Contrary to these widely popularized models of unilinear evolution, I would like to draw attention to alternative theories emphasizing the horizontal transfer of words, phenotypes/genotypes, and culture traits. Examples are the method of areal typology in linguistics, the theory of endosymbiosis in biology, and the anti-evolutionist attitude in Boasian anthropology, combined with an emphasis on the diffusion of culture traits. Further, it shall be pointed out that, even when--after the general dismissal of evolutionist ideas in the beginning of the twentieth century--the idea of co-evolutionary processes in the development of human populations and languages was again forwarded in the late twentieth century, this `modern synthesis' of genetics, linguistics and archeology relied largely on interdisciplinary reticulations between sciences and humanities and serves as another example of reticulate evolution.},

Claims for lineage-specific LGT to eukaryotes outside the context of organelle origins and claims of continuous LGT to eukaryotic lineages are more problematic. If eukaryotes acquire genes from prokaryotes continuously during evolution, then sequenced eukaryote genomes should harbor evidence for recent LGT, like prokaryotic genomes do.},

For data collection, this megastudy used the Web-based crowdsourcing technology offered by the Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our data indicate that the ratings collected in this way are as valid and reliable as those collected in laboratory conditions (the correlation between our ratings and those collected in the lab from U.S. students reached .93 for a subsample of 2,500 monosyllabic words). We also show that our AoA ratings explain a substantial percentage of the variance in the lexical-decision data of the English Lexicon Project, over and above the effects of log frequency, word length, and similarity to other words. This is true not only for the lemmas used in our rating study, but also for their inflected forms. We further discuss the relationships of AoA with other predictors of word recognition and illustrate the utility of AoA ratings for research on vocabulary growth.},

    abstract = {<p>The Slavic branch of the Balto-Slavic sub-family of Indo-European languages underwent rapid divergence as a result of the spatial expansion of its speakers from Central-East Europe, in early medieval times. This expansion–mainly to East Europe and the northern Balkans–resulted in the incorporation of genetic components from numerous autochthonous populations into the Slavic gene pools. Here, we characterize genetic variation in all extant ethnic groups speaking Balto-Slavic languages by analyzing mitochondrial DNA (n = 6,876), Y-chromosomes (n = 6,079) and genome-wide SNP profiles (n = 296), within the context of other European populations. We also reassess the phylogeny of Slavic languages within the Balto-Slavic branch of Indo-European. We find that genetic distances among Balto-Slavic populations, based on autosomal and Y-chromosomal loci, show a high correlation (0.9) both with each other and with geography, but a slightly lower correlation (0.7) with mitochondrial DNA and linguistic affiliation. The data suggest that genetic diversity of the present-day Slavs was predominantly shaped <italic>in situ</italic>, and we detect two different substrata: ‘central-east European’ for West and East Slavs, and ‘south-east European’ for South Slavs. A pattern of distribution of segments identical by descent between groups of East-West and South Slavs suggests shared ancestry or a modest gene flow between those two groups, which might derive from the historic spread of Slavic people.</p>},

Observations of the vernacular provide the most systematic basis for linguistic theory, but have been the most difficult kinds of data for linguists to obtain; techniques for solving the problems encountered are outlined.

    abstract = {Scientific activities take place within the structured sets of ideas and assumptions that define a field and its practices. The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways\textemdashone that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the \textquoteleftextended evolutionary synthesis\textquoteright (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism\textendashenvironment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},

Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)] and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 7327 (2007); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 1118 (2008)], Blondel [J.

    abstract = {The Sino-Tibetan language family is one of the largest language families in the world, both in terms of number of speakers and in terms of geographic distribution. It includes the majority languages of China and Myanmar, plus minority languages in China, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and Northeast India. Three main factors have been involved in the formation of the present-day Sino-Tibetan language family: a shared genetic origin, divergent population movements (i.e. innovations appearing in the different groups after their split), and language contact (among themselves and with non-Sino-Tibetan languages). Population movements and language contact have in fact generally been two aspects of a single phenomenon. This paper looks at the history of the development of the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family from the point of view of population movements and language contact, to show the role language contact has had in the formation of the branch as we know it today. These factors have been an important part of the development of the branch from its origin in the central plains of what is now north China, in the valley of the Yellow River, some 6,500 years ago, right up to the present, and are still the main factors in language change today.},

According to Gould, the root cause of these oversights was confirmation bias by psychometricians, an unwarranted commitment to the idea that intelligence was a fixed, immutable quality of people. By virtue of a similar, systemic interpretive bias, in the last two decades, numerous contemporary researchers in comparative psychology have claimed human superiority over apes in social intelligence, based on two-group comparisons between postindustrial, Western Europeans and captive apes, where the apes have been isolated from European styles of social interaction, and tested with radically different procedures. Moreover, direct comparisons of humans with apes suffer from pervasive lapses in argumentation: Research designs in wide contemporary use are inherently mute about the underlying psychological causes of overt behavior. Here we analyze these problems and offer a more fruitful approach to the comparative study of social intelligence, which focuses on specific individual learning histories in specific ecological circumstances.},

The interval between the presentation of the two tones, and the level of interference during this interval, were manipulated. Native speakers did better at discriminating tones from their own languages than the other two groups of subjects, for both lexical and nonlexical tones. Subjects did worst when they were required to count backward during the interstimulus interval. Cantonese speakers were better than both Mandarin and English speakers at discriminating Cantonese tones, and there was no difference between Mandarin and English speakers, except in one condition. Mandarin speakers did better than both Cantonese and English speakers, and Cantonese speakers did better than English speakers, at discriminating Mandarin tones.

This striking similarity between biological and linguistic evolution allows us to apply phylogenetic methods to explore how languages, as well as the people who speak them, are related to one another through evolutionary history. Language phylogenies constructed with lexical data have so far revealed population expansions of Austronesian, Indo-European and Bantu speakers. However, how robustly a phylogenetic approach can chart the history of language evolution and what language phylogenies reveal about human prehistory must be investigated more thoroughly on a global scale. Here we report a phylogeny of 59 Japonic languages and dialects. We used this phylogeny to estimate time depth of its root and compared it with the time suggested by an agricultural expansion scenario for Japanese origin. In agreement with the scenario, our results indicate that Japonic languages descended from a common ancestor approximately 2182 years ago. Together with archaeological and biological evidence, our results suggest that the first farmers of Japan had a profound impact on the origins of both people and languages. On a broader level, our results are consistent with a theory that agricultural expansion is the principal factor for shaping global linguistic diversity.},

Spatial and temporal aspects of language evolution are particularly crucial for understanding demographic history, as they allow us to identify when and where the languages originated, as well as how they spread across the globe. Here we apply Bayesian phylogeographic methods to reconstruct spatiotemporal evolution of the Ainu language: an endangered language spoken by an indigenous group that once thrived in northern Japan. The conventional dual-structure model has long argued that modern Ainu are direct descendants of a single, Pleistocene human lineage from Southeast Asia, namely the Jomon people. In contrast, recent evidence from archaeological, anthropological and genetic evidence suggest that the Ainu are an outcome of significant genetic and cultural contributions from Siberian hunter-gatherers, the Okhotsk, who migrated into northern Hokkaido around 900–1600 years ago. Estimating from 19 Ainu language varieties preserved five decades ago, our analysis shows that they are descendants of a common ancestor who spread from northern Hokkaido around 1300 years ago. In addition to several lines of emerging evidence, our phylogeographic analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that recent expansion of the Okhotsk to northern Hokkaido had a profound impact on the origins of the Ainu people and their culture, and hence calls for a refinement to the dual-structure model.</p></sec>},

    abstract = {Phylogenomic analyses of large sets of genes or proteins have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the tree of life. However, problems arise because estimated phylogenies from individual loci often differ because of different histories, systematic bias, or stochastic error. We have developed Concaterpillar, a hierarchical clustering method based on likelihood-ratio testing that identifies congruent loci for phylogenomic analysis. Concaterpillar also includes a test for shared relative evolutionary rates between genes indicating whether they should be analyzed separately or by concatenation. In simulation studies, the performance of this method is excellent when a multiple comparison correction is applied. We analyzed a phylogenomic data set of 60 translational protein sequences from the major supergroups of eukaryotes and identified three congruent subsets of proteins. Analysis of the largest set indicates improved congruence relative to the full data set and produced a phylogeny with stronger support for five eukaryote supergroups including the Opisthokonts, the Plantae, the stramenopiles + Apicomplexa (chromalveolates), the Amoebozoa, and the Excavata. In contrast, the phylogeny of the second largest set indicates a close relationship between stramenopiles and red algae, to the exclusion of alveolates, suggesting gene transfer from the red algal secondary symbiont to the ancestral stramenopile host nucleus during the origin of their chloroplast. Investigating phylogenomic data sets for conflicting signals has the potential to both improve phylogenetic accuracy and inform our understanding of genome evolution.},

In addition, assessment methods developed in the past have been designed for reasonably small numbers of loci and scale poorly for larger data sets. However, there are currently over a thousand complete genome sequences available and of interest to evolutionary biologists, and these sequences are predominantly from microbial organisms, whose molecular evolution is much less frequently tree-like than that of multicellular life forms. As such, the level of incongruence in these data is expected to be high. We present a congruence method that accommodates both very large numbers of genes and high degrees of incongruence. Our method uses clustering algorithms to identify subsets of genes based on similarity of phylogenetic signal. It involves only a single phylogenetic analysis per gene, and therefore, computation time scales nearly linearly with the number of genes in the data set. We show that our method performs very well with sets of sequence alignments simulated under a wide variety of conditions. In addition, we present an analysis of core genes of prokaryotes, often assumed to have been largely vertically inherited, in which we identify two highly incongruent classes of genes. This result is consistent with the complexity hypothesis.},

    abstract = {Bacteriophage genomes show pervasive mosaicism, indicating the importance of horizontal gene exchange in their evolution. Phage genomes represent unique combinations of modules, each of them with a different phylogenetic history. The traditional classification, based on a variety of criteria such as nucleic acid type (single/double-stranded DNA/RNA), morphology, and host range, appeared inconsistent with sequence analyses. With the genomic era, an ever increasing number of sequenced phages cannot be classified, in part due to a lack of morphological information and in part to the intrinsic incapability of tree-based methods to efficiently deal with mosaicism. This problem led some virologists to call for a moratorium on the creation of additional taxa in the order Caudovirales, in order to let virologists discuss classification schemes that might better suit phage evolution. In this context, we propose a framework for a reticulate classification of phages based on gene content. Starting from gene families, we built a weighted graph, where nodes represent phages and edges represent phage-phage similarities in terms of shared genes. We then apply various measures of graph topology to analyze the resulting graph. Most double-stranded DNA phages are found in a single component. The values of the clustering coefficient and closeness distinguish temperate from virulent phages, whereas chimeric phages are characterized by a high betweenness coefficient. We apply a 2-step clustering method to this graph to generate a reticulate classification of phages: Each phage is associated with a membership vector, which quantitatively characterizes its membership to the set of clusters. Furthermore, we cluster genes based on their "phylogenetic profiles" to define "evolutionary cohesive modules." In virulent phages, evolutionary modules span several functional categories, whereas in temperate phages they correspond better to functional modules. Moreover, despite the fact that modules only cover a fraction of all phage genes, phage groups can be distinguished by their different combination of modules, serving the bases for a higher level reticulate classification. These 2 classification schemes provide an automatic and dynamic way of representing the relationships within the phage population and can be extended to include newly sequenced phage genomes, as well as other types of genetic elements.},

There has been much concern with the symbolism of space in anthropological writings, but little on concepts of space in practical activities. This neglect of everyday spatial notions may be due to unwitting ethnocentrism, the assumption in Western thinking generally that notions of space are universally of a single kind. Recent work shows that systems of spatial reckoning and description can in fact be quite divergent across cultures, linguistic differences correlating with distinct cognitive tendencies. This unexpected cultural variation raises interesting questions concerning the relation between cultural and linguistic concepts and the biological foundations of cognition. It argues for more sophisticated models relating culture and cognition than we currently have available.},

This paper explores the possibility of using standard, well-behaved Markov models for estimating morphological phylogenies (including branch lengths) under the likelihood criterion. An important modification of standard Markov models involves making the likelihood conditional on characters being variable, because constant characters are absent in morphological data sets. Without this modification, branch lengths are often overestimated, resulting in potentially serious biases in tree topology selection. Several new avenues of research are opened by an explicitly model-based approach to phylogenetic analysis of discrete morphological data, including combined-data likelihood analyses (morphology + sequence data), likelihood ratio tests, and Bayesian analyses.},

    abstract = {Abstract Are the forms of words systematically related to their meaning? The arbitrariness of the sign has long been a foundational part of our understanding of human language. Theories of communication predict a relationship between length and meaning, however: Longer descriptions should be more conceptually complex. Here we show that both the lexicons of human languages and individual speakers encode the relationship between linguistic and conceptual complexity. Experimentally, participants mapped longer words to more complex objects in comprehension and production tasks and across a range of stimuli. Explicit judgments of conceptual complexity were also highly correlated with implicit measures of study time in a memory task, suggesting that complexity is directly related to basic cognitive processes. Observationally, judgments of conceptual complexity for a sample of real words correlate highly with their length across 80 languages, even controlling for frequency, familiarity, imageability, and concreteness. While word lengths are systematically related to usage—both frequency and contextual predictability—our results reveal a systematic relationship with meaning as well. They point to a general regularity in the design of lexicons and suggest that pragmatic pressures may influence the structure of the lexicon.},

    abstract = {Measuring the phylogenetic information content of data has a long history in systematics. Here we explore a Bayesian approach to information content estimation. The entropy of the posterior distribution compared with the entropy of the prior distribution provides a natural way to measure information content. If the data have no information relevant to ranking tree topologies beyond the information supplied by the prior, the posterior and prior will be identical. Information in data discourages consideration of some hypotheses allowed by the prior, resulting in a posterior distribution that is more concentrated (has lower entropy) than the prior. We focus on measuring information about tree topology using marginal posterior distributions of tree topologies. We show that both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of topological information content estimation improve with use of the conditional clade distribution, which also allows topological information content to be partitioned by clade. We explore two important applications of our method: providing a compelling definition of saturation and detecting conflict among data partitions that can negatively affect analyses of concatenated data.

Based on the features, we propose an evolving language network model. Finally, we use this model to simulate the character co-occurrence networks (nodes are characters, and two characters are connected by an edge if they are adjacent to each other) constructed from essays in 11 different periods of China, and find that characters that appear with high frequency in old words are likely to be reused when new words are formed.},

For each of the Chinese language co-occurrence networks constructed from four literary genres, i.e., essay, popular science article, news report, and novel, it is found that the largest eigenvalue depends on the network size N , the number of edges, the average shortest path length, and the clustering coefficient. Moreover, it is found that their node-degree distributions all follow a power-law. The number of different eigenvalues, N λ , is found numerically to increase in the manner of N λ ∝ log N for novel and N λ ∝ N for the other three literary genres. An “M” shape or a triangle-like distribution appears in their spectral densities. The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is mostly localized to a node with the largest degree. For the above observed phenomena, mathematical analysis is provided with interpretation from a linguistic perspective.},

To explore the genetic relationships of these ethnic minorities, we systematically surveyed the variation of 10 autosomal STR markers of 1,538 individuals from 30 populations of 25 ethnic minorities, of which the majority were chosen from Southwest China, especially Yunnan Province. With genotyped data of the markers, we constructed phylogenies of these populations with both <italic>D<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>C</sub></italic> measures and performed a principal component analysis, as well as a clustering analysis by <italic>structure</italic>. Results showed that we successfully recovered the genetic structure of analyzed populations formed by historical migrations. Aggregation patterns of these populations accord well with their linguistic affiliations, suggesting that deciphering of genetic relationships does in fact offer clues for study of ethnic differentiation.</p>},

    abstract = {The amount of data from languages spoken all over the world is rapidly increasing. Traditional manual methods in historical linguistics need to face the challenges brought by this influx of data. Automatic approaches to word comparison could provide invaluable help to pre-analyze data which can be later enhanced by experts. In this way, computational approaches can take care of the repetitive and schematic tasks leaving experts to concentrate on answering interesting questions. Here we test the potential of automatic methods to detect etymologically related words (cognates) in cross-linguistic data. Using a newly compiled database of expert cognate judgments across five different language families, we compare how well different automatic approaches distinguish related from unrelated words. Our results show that automatic methods can identify cognates with a very high degree of accuracy, reaching 89% for the best-performing method Infomap. We identify the specific strengths and weaknesses of these different methods and point to major challenges for future approaches. Current automatic approaches for cognate detection—although not perfect—could become an important component of future research in historical linguistics.},

    abstract = {The Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications (CLICS), has established a computer-assisted framework for the interactive representation of cross-linguistic colexification patterns. In its current form, it has proven to be a useful tool for various kinds of investigation into cross-linguistic semantic associations, ranging from studies on semantic change, patterns of conceptualization, and linguistic paleontology. But CLICS has also been criticized for obvious shortcomings, ranging from the underlying dataset, which still contains many errors, up to the limits of cross-linguistic colexification studies in general. Building on recent standardization efforts reflected in the Cross-Linguistic Data Formats initiative (CLDF) and novel approaches for fast, efficient, and reliable data aggregation, we have created a new database for cross-linguistic colexifications, which not only supersedes the original CLICS database in terms of coverage but also offers a much more principled procedure for the creation, curation and aggregation of datasets. The paper presents the new database and discusses its major features.},

    abstract = {The origin of Tibetans remains one of the most contentious puzzles in history, anthropology, and genetics. Analyses of deeply sequenced (30×–60×) genomes of 38 Tibetan highlanders and 39 Han Chinese lowlanders, together with available data on archaic and modern humans, allow us to comprehensively characterize the ancestral makeup of Tibetans and uncover their origins. Non-modern human sequences compose ∼6% of the Tibetan gene pool and form unique haplotypes in some genomic regions, where Denisovan-like, Neanderthal-like, ancient-Siberian-like, and unknown ancestries are entangled and elevated. The shared ancestry of Tibetan-enriched sequences dates back to ∼62,000–38,000 years ago, predating the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and representing early colonization of the plateau. Nonetheless, most of the Tibetan gene pool is of modern human origin and diverged from that of Han Chinese ∼15,000 to ∼9,000 years ago, which can be largely attributed to post-LGM arrivals. Analysis of ∼200 contemporary populations showed that Tibetans share ancestry with populations from East Asia (∼82%), Central Asia and Siberia (∼11%), South Asia (∼6%), and western Eurasia and Oceania (∼1%). Our results support that Tibetans arose from a mixture of multiple ancestral gene pools but that their origins are much more complicated and ancient than previously suspected. We provide compelling evidence of the co-existence of Paleolithic and Neolithic ancestries in the Tibetan gene pool, indicating a genetic continuity between pre-historical highland-foragers and present-day Tibetans. In particular, highly differentiated sequences harbored in highlanders’ genomes were most likely inherited from pre-LGM settlers of multiple ancestral origins (SUNDer) and maintained in high frequency by natural selection.},

A statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described. Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of documents in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of docu- ments by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branched structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.},

    abstract = {Complex cellular machines and processes are commonly believed to be products of selection, and it is typically understood to be the job of evolutionary biologists to show how selective advantage can account for each step in their origin and subsequent growth in complexity. Here, we describe how complex machines might instead evolve in the absence of positive selection through a process of "presuppression," first termed constructive neutral evolution (CNE) more than a decade ago. If an autonomously functioning cellular component acquires mutations that make it dependent for function on another, pre-existing component or process, and if there are multiple ways in which such dependence may arise, then dependence inevitably will arise and reversal to independence is unlikely. Thus, CNE is a unidirectional evolutionary ratchet leading to complexity, if complexity is equated with the number of components or steps necessary to carry out a cellular process. CNE can explain "functions" that seem to make little sense in terms of cellular economy, like RNA editing or splicing, but it may also contribute to the complexity of machines with clear benefit to the cell, like the ribosome, and to organismal complexity overall. We suggest that CNE-based evolutionary scenarios are in these and other cases less forced than the selectionist or adaptationist narratives that are generally told.},

    abstract = {We present a new set of subjective age-of-acquisition (AoA) ratings for 299 words (158 nouns, 141 verbs) in 25 languages from five language families (Afro-Asiatic: Semitic languages; Altaic: one Turkic language: Indo-European: Baltic, Celtic, Germanic, Hellenic, Slavic, and Romance languages; Niger-Congo: one Bantu language; Uralic: Finnic and Ugric languages). Adult native speakers reported the age at which they had learned each word. We present a comparison of the AoA ratings across all languages by contrasting them in pairs. This comparison shows a consistency in the orders of ratings across the 25 languages. The data were then analyzed (1) to ascertain how the demographic characteristics of the participants influenced AoA estimations and (2) to assess differences caused by the exact form of the target question (when did you learn vs. when do children learn this word); (3) to compare the ratings obtained in our study to those of previous studies; and (4) to assess the validity of our study by comparison with quasi-objective AoA norms derived from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI). All 299 words were judged as being acquired early (mostly before the age of 6 years). AoA ratings were associated with the raters' social or language status, but not with the raters' age or education. Parents reported words as being learned earlier, and bilinguals reported learning them later. Estimations of the age at which children learn the words revealed significantly lower ratings of AoA. Finally, comparisons with previous AoA and MB-CDI norms support the validity of the present estimations. Our AoA ratings are available for research or other purposes.},

Here we explore approaches to phylogenetic inference designed to consider retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism. We examine how the reconstructability of a species (or population) phylogeny is affected by (a) the number of loci used to estimate the phylogeny and (b) the number of individuals sampled per species. Even in difficult cases with considerable incomplete lineage sorting (times between divergences less than 1 Ne generations), we found the reconstructed species trees matched the “true” species trees in at least three out of five partitions, as long as a reasonable number of individuals per species were sampled. We also studied the tradeoff between sampling more loci versus more individuals. Although increasing the number of loci gives more accurate trees for a given sampling effort with deeper species trees (e.g., total depth of 10 Ne generations), sampling more individuals often gives better results than sampling more loci with shallower species trees (e.g., depth = 1 Ne). Taken together, these results demonstrate that gene sequences retain enough signal to achieve an accurate estimate of phylogeny despite widespread incomplete lineage sorting. Continued improvement in our methods to reconstruct phylogeny near the species level will require a shift to a compound model that considers not only nucleotide or character state substitutions, but also the population genetics processes of lineage sorting.},

If so, one would expect these parts to have distinct names which correspond in meaning across languages. To test this proposal, we compared three unrelated languages—Dutch, Japanese, and Indonesian—and found both naming systems and boundaries of even basic body part terms display variation across languages. Bottom-up cues alone cannot explain natural language semantic systems; there simply is not a one-to-one mapping of the body semantic system to the body structural description. Although body parts are flexibly construed across languages, body parts semantics are, nevertheless, constrained by non-linguistic representations in the body structural description, suggesting these are necessary, although not sufficient, in accounting for aspects of the body lexicon.},

Contrary to received opinion, I argue that there is a unique and interesting concept of a system that underlies the expressed interests of general systems researchers and that it can be given a satisfactory explication. The concept in question has systems as extralinguistic entities that we theorize about, namely, certain sorts of sets of re-related elements. Criteria for its explication are suggested; examples of systems, earlier analyses, and various objections are all considered in leading up to a partial formal explication of the concept and a statement of additional open problems.},

    abstract = {Abstract Phylogenies are the commonly used tools for the prediction of ancestry of present day organisms from the past decades. Several methods have been developed to construct phylogenetic trees that predict the history of species by direct linkage of edges. Very few studies have been developed for the phylogenetic networks (which is the generalization of trees). Presently, the methods used to determine phylogenetic networks are based on distance measures or character measures of the sequences of species. It is a very challenging task for computational biologists to find the exact method that can predict the accurate networks of organisms. In this study, a phylogenetic network construction model based on basic graph theory concepts is reported. This model finds the distance matrix of every sequence considered in the study. The two features (positioning and stack interactions) of every \DNA\ sequence and their combined effect have been taken into account to calculate the distances. Results suggested that reticulate events can be observed by using the distances obtained by the proposed method and no such event is predicted by using the distances calculated by the previous method. The important results obtained in the form of distances are 1.637300, 2.000000, 0.932700, 2.331300, 2.829200 and the significance of these values is to represent the different reticulation events among the sequences for different features. Hence distances calculated by this model gives better insights to study the phylogenetic networks.},

    abstract = {<p>Political and economic risks arise from social phenomena that spread within and across countries. Regime changes, protest movements, and stock market and default shocks can have ramifications across the globe. Quantitative models have made great strides at predicting these events in recent decades but incorporate few explicitly measured cultural variables. However, in recent years cultural evolutionary theory has emerged as a major paradigm to understand the inheritance and diffusion of human cultural variation. Here, we combine these two strands of research by proposing that measures of socio-linguistic affiliation derived from language phylogenies track variation in cultural norms that influence how political and economic changes diffuse across the globe. First, we show that changes over time in a country?s democratic or autocratic character correlate with simultaneous changes among their socio-linguistic affiliations more than with changes of spatially proximate countries. Second, we find that models of changes in sovereign default status favor including socio-linguistic affiliations in addition to spatial data. These findings suggest that better measurement of cultural networks could be profoundly useful to policy makers who wish to diversify commercial, social, and other forms of investment across political and economic risks on an international scale.</p>},

    journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America},
    year = {2014},
    abstract = {The ordering of subject, verb, and object is one of the fundamental components of the syntax of natural languages. The distribution of basic word orders across the world’s languages is highly nonuniform, with the majority of languages being either subject-object-verb (SOV) or subject-verb-object (SVO). Explaining this fact using psychological accounts of language acquisition or processing requires understanding how the present distribution has resulted from ancestral distributions and the rates of change between orders. We show that Bayesian phylogenetics can provide quantitative answers to three important questions: how word orders are likely to change over time, which word orders were dominant historically, and whether strong inferences about the origins of syntax can be drawn from modern languages. We find that SOV to SVO change is more common than the reverse and VSO to SVO change is more common than VSO to SOV, and that if the seven language families we consider share a common ancestor then that common ancestor likely had SOV word order, but also that there are limits on how confidently we can make inferences about ancestral word order based on modern-day observations. These results shed new light on old questions from historical linguistics and provide clear targets for psychological explanations of word-order distributions.},

BEASTling transforms comparatively short and human-readable configuration files into the XML files used by BEAST to specify analyses. By taking advantage of Creative Commons-licensed data from the Glottolog language catalog, BEASTling allows the user to conveniently filter datasets using names for recognised language families, to impose monophyly constraints so that inferred language trees are backward compatible with Glottolog classifications, or to assign geographic location data to languages for phylogeographic analyses. Support for the emerging cross-linguistic linked data format (CLDF) permits easy incorporation of data published in cross-linguistic linked databases into analyses. BEASTling is intended to make the power of Bayesian analysis more accessible to historical linguists without strong programming backgrounds, in the hopes of encouraging communication and collaboration between those developing computational models of language evolution (who are typically not linguists) and relevant domain experts.},

    abstract = {Motivation: Proteins can be naturally classified into families of homologous sequences that derive from a common ancestor. The comparison of homologous sequences and the analysis of their phylogenetic relationships provide useful information regarding the function and evolution of genes. One important difficulty of clustering methods is to distinguish highly divergent homologous sequences from sequences that only share partial homology due to evolution by protein domain rearrangements. Existing clustering methods require parameters that have to be set a priori. Given the variability in the evolution pattern among proteins, these parameters cannot be optimal for all gene families.Results: We propose a strategy that aims at clustering sequences homologous over their entire length, and that takes into account the pattern of substitution specific to each gene family. Sequences are first all compared with each other and clustered into pre-families, based on pairwise similarity criteria, with permissive parameters to optimize sensitivity. Pre-families are then divided into homogeneous clusters, based on the topology of the similarity network. Finally, clusters are progressively merged into families, for which we compute multiple alignments, and we use a model selection technique to find the optimal tradeoff between the number of families and multiple alignment likelihood. To evaluate this method, called HiFiX, we analyzed simulated sequences and manually curated datasets. These tests showed that HiFiX is the only method robust to both sequence divergence and domain rearrangements. HiFiX is fast enough to be used on very large datasets.Availability and implementation: The Python software HiFiX is freely available at http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/hifixContact: vincent.miele@univ-lyon1.frSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Based on such probabilities, a probability alignment that includes the most probable correspondences is proposed. In the cases of highly similar sequence pairs, the probability alignments agree with the maximum similarity alignments that correspond to the alignments with the maximum similarity score. Significant correspondences in the probability alignments are those whose probabilities are >0.5. The probability alignment method is applied to a few protein pairs, and results indicate that such highly probable correspondences in the probability alignments are probably correct correspondences that agree with the structural alignments and that incorrect correspondences in the maximum similarity alignments are usually insignificant correspondences in the probability alignments. The root mean square deviations in superimposition of corresponding residues tend to be smaller for significant correspondences in the probability alignments than for all correspondences in the maximum similarity alignments, indicating that incorrect correspondences in the maximum similarity alignments tend to be insignificant correspondences in probability alignments. This fact is also confirmed in 109 protein pairs that are similar to each other with sequence identities between 90 and 35%. In addition, the probability alignment method may better predict correct correspondences than the maximum similarity alignment method. Probability alignments do, of course, depend on a scoring scheme but are less sensitive to the value of parameters such as gap penalties. The present probability alignment method is useful for constructing reliable alignments based on the probabilities of correspondences and can be used with any scoring scheme.},

    abstract = {The wealth of available genomic data presents an unrivaled opportunity to study the molecular basis of evolution. Studies on gene family expansions and site-dependent analyses have already helped establish important insights into how proteins facilitate adaptation. However, efforts to conduct full-scale cross-genomic comparisons between species are challenged by both growing amounts of data and the inherent difficulty in accurately inferring homology between deeply rooted species. Proteins, in comparison, evolve by means of domain rearrangements, a process more amenable to study given the strength of profile-based homology inference and the lower rates with which rearrangements occur. However, adapting to a constantly changing environment can require molecular modulations beyond reach of rearrangement alone. Here, we explore rates and functional implications of novel domain emergence in contrast to domain gain and loss in 20 arthropod species of the pancrustacean clade. Emerging domains are more likely disordered in structure and spread more rapidly within their genomes than established domains. Furthermore, although domain turnover occurs at lower rates than gene family turnover, we find strong evidence that the emergence of novel domains is foremost associated with environmental adaptation such as abiotic stress response. The results presented here illustrate the simplicity with which domain-based analyses can unravel key players of nature's adaptational machinery, complementing the classical site-based analyses of adaptation.},

OATS uses RDF, SPARQL and Unicode to facilitate resource discovery and intelligent search over linguistic data. The knowledge base includes an ontological description of writing systems and relations for mapping transcription system segments to an interlingua pivot, the IPA. It includes orthographic and phonemic inventories from 203 African languages, which were mined from the Web. OATS is motivated by four use cases: querying data in the knowledge base via IPA, querying it in native orthography, error checking of digitized data, and conversion between transcription systems. The model in this paper implements each of these use cases.},

We need to understand this analogy thoroughly, including how well anthropology data fit the model of a phylogenetic tree, as used in biology. I provide a direct comparison of anthropology datasets with both phenotype and genotype datasets from biology. The anthropology datasets fit the tree model approximately as well as do the genotype data, which is detectably worse than the fit of the phenotype data. This is true for datasets with &lt;500 parsimony-informative characters, as well as for larger datasets. This implies that cross-cultural (horizontal) processes have been important in the evolution of cultural artifacts, as well as branching historical (vertical) processes, and thus a phylogenetic network will be a more appropriate model than a phylogenetic tree.},

    abstract = {Present-day machine translation technologies crucially depend on the size and quality of lexical resources. Much of recent research in the area has been concerned with methods to build bilingual dictionaries automatically. In this paper we propose a methodology for the automatic detection of cognates between two languages based solely on the orthography of words. From a set of known cognates, the method induces rules capturing regularities of orthographic mutations that a word undergoes when migrating from one language into the other. The rules are then applied as a preprocessing step before measuring the orthographic similarity between putative cognates. As a result, the method allows to achieve an improvement in the F-measure of 11,86 % in comparison with detecting cognates based only on the edit distance between them.},

A detailed analysis was done of a 7,260 word sample from the Carroll, Davies and Richman, Word Frequency Book. Projecting from this sample to the total vocabulary of school English, our best estimate is that there are about 88,500 distinct words. Furthermore, for every word a child learns, we estimate that there are an average of one to three additional related words that should also be understandable to the child, the exact number depending on how well the child is able to utilize context and morphology to induce meanings. Based on our analysis, a reconcilation of estimates of children's vocabulary size was undertaken, which showed that the extreme divergence in estimates is due mainly to the definition of "word" adopted. Our findings indicate that even the most ruthlessly systematic direct vocabulary instruction could neither account for a significant proportion of all the words children actually learn, nor cover more than a modest proportion of the words they will encounter in school reading materials. /// [French] Le but de cette recherche était de déterminer le nombre de mots distincts dans l'Anglais scolaire imprimé. Une analyse détaillée a été faite d'un échantillon de 7260 mots à partir du Livre de fréquence de mots Carroll, Davies et Richman. En projetant à partir de cet échantillon jusqu'au vocabulaire total de l'Anglais scolaire, notre estimation meilleure est qu'il y a environ 88500 mots distincts. De plus, pour chaque mot qu'un enfant apprend, nous estimons qu'il y a une moyenne d'un à trois mots additionnels en rapport qui devraient être aussi compris par l'enfant, le nombre exact dépendant de combien l'enfant est capable d'utiliser le contexte et la morphologie pour produire des significations. Basée sur notre analyse, on a entrepris une réconciliation d'estimations de la quantité de vocabulaire des enfants, qui a montré que l'extrême divergence en estimations est due principalement à la définition du "mot" adopté. Nos découvertes indiquent que même l'instruction de vocabulaire directe la plus systématique ne pourrait ni compter pour une proportion significative de tous les mots que les enfants apprennent vraiment, ni couvrir plus qu'une proportion modeste de mots qu'ils rencontreront dans le matériel de lecture scolaire. /// [Spanish] El objetivo de esta investigacion era determinar el número de distintas palabras en el inglés escolar escrito.

Además, por cada palabra que un niño aprende, calculamos que hay un promedio de una a tres palabras relacionadas adicionales que también deberían comprenderse por el niño, dependiendo el número exacto hasta qué punto el niño es capaz de utilizar contexto y morfología para inducir significado. Basado en nuestro análisis, se procedió a una conciliación de cálculos sobre la extensión del vocabulario de los niños, que demostró que la extrema discrepancia en los cálculos se debe principalmente a cuál definición se adopta sobre lo que es "palabra".

    abstract = {Eukaryotic gene fusion and fission events are mechanistically more complicated than in prokaryotes, and their quantitative contributions to genome evolution are still poorly understood. We have identified all differentially composite or split genes in 2 fully sequenced plant genomes, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana. Out of 10,172 orthologous gene pairs, 60 (0.6% of the total) revealed a verified fusion or fission event in either lineage after the divergence of O. sativa and A. thaliana. Polarizing these events by outgroup comparison revealed differences in the rate of gene fission but not of gene fusion in the rice and Arabidopsis lineages. Gene fission occurred at a higher rate than gene fusion in the O. sativa lineage and was furthermore more common in rice than in Arabidopsis. Nucleotide insertion bias has promoted gene fission in the O. sativa lineage, consistent with its generally longer nucleotide sequences than A. thaliana in selectively neutral regions, and with the abundance of transposable elements in rice. The divergence time of monocots and dicots (140–200 Myr) indicates that gene fusion/fission events occur at an average rate of 1 × 10−11 to 2 × 10−11 events per gene per year, ∼100-fold slower than the average per site nuclear nucleotide substitution rate in these lineages. Gene fusion and fission are thus rare and slow processes in higher plant genomes; they should be of utility to address deeper evolutionary relationships among plants—and the relationship of plants to other eukaryotic lineages—where sequence-based phylogenies provide equivocal or conflicting results.},

    abstract = {The immunology of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections has peculiar characteristics. The long latency for cervical cancer development after primary viral infection suggests mechanisms that may aid the virus in avoiding the host immunosurveillance and establishing persistent infections. In order to understand whether molecular mimicry phenomena might explain the ability of HPV to avoid a protective immune response by the host cell, sequence similarity between HPV16 E7 oncoprotein and human self-proteins was examined by computer-assisted analysis. Data were obtained showing that the HPV16 E7 protein has high and widespread similarity to several human proteins involved in a number of critical regulatory processes. In addition, multiple identical and different E7 peptide motifs are present in the same human protein. Thus, sharing of common motifs between viral oncoproteins and molecules of normal cells may be one cause underlying the scarce immunogenicity of HPV infections. The hypothesis is advanced that synthetic peptides harbouring viral motifs not and/or scarcely represented in the host's cellular proteins may represent a valuable immunotherapeutic approach for cervical cancer treatment.},

Branch points (components) comprise part of the information of a cladogram (the component information); and branch tips (terminal taxa) comprise the other part (the term information). In an analysis of five cladograms published on allodapine bees, components were segregated into four categories: (1) replicates; (2) components non-combinable with replicates; (3) components combinable with replicates and with each other; (4) components individually combinable with replicates but not with each other. Components replicated in cladograms based on independent data sets have low, but specifiable, probabilities of occurrence. For the five cladograms of bees, the replicates were found to be non-random (P = 10-17%). Through cladistic synthesis, categories (1) and (3) were combined in a general cladogram-the best estimate of the only apparent cladistic parameter. In a comparison of the five cladograms of bees, phyletic procedures proved more efficient and more informative than phenetic procedures in estimating the cladistic parameter, as represented by the general cladogram. The number of characters on which each of the five cladograms is based seems either uncorrelated, or inversely correlated, with the cladogram's efficiency in estimating the cladistic parameter.},

    abstract = {Language evolution is traditionally described in terms of family trees with ancestral languages splitting into descendent languages. However, it has long been recognized that language evolution also entails horizontal components, most commonly through lexical borrowing. For example, the English language was heavily influenced by Old Norse and Old French; eight per cent of its basic vocabulary is borrowed. Borrowing is a distinctly non-tree-like process—akin to horizontal gene transfer in genome evolution—that cannot be recovered by phylogenetic trees. Here, we infer the frequency of hidden borrowing among 2346 cognates (etymologically related words) of basic vocabulary distributed across 84 Indo-European languages. The dataset includes 124 (5%) known borrowings. Applying the uniformitarian principle to inventory dynamics in past and present basic vocabularies, we find that 1373 (61%) of the cognates have been affected by borrowing during their history. Our approach correctly identified 117 (94%) known borrowings. Reconstructed phylogenetic networks that capture both vertical and horizontal components of evolutionary history reveal that, on average, eight per cent of the words of basic vocabulary in each Indo-European language were involved in borrowing during evolution. Basic vocabulary is often assumed to be relatively resistant to borrowing. Our results indicate that the impact of borrowing is far more widespread than previously thought.},

    abstract = {The six and a half thousand languages spoken by humankind are very unevenly distributed across the globe. Language diversity generally increases as one moves from the poles toward the equator and is very low in arid environments. Two belts of extremely high language diversity can be identified. One runs through West and Central Africa, while the other covers South and South-East Asia and the Pacific. Most of the world’s languages are found in these two areas. This paper attempts to explain aspects of the global distribution of language diversity. It is proposed that a key factor influencing it has been climatic variability. Where the climate allows contin- uous food production throughout the year, small groups of people can be reliably self-sufficient and so populations fragment into many small languages. Where the variability of the climate is greater, the size of social network necessary for reliable subsistence is larger, and so languages tend to be more widespread. A regression analysis relating the number of languages spoken in the major tropical countries to the variability of their climates is performed and the results support the hypothesis. The geographical patterning of languages has, however, begun to be destroyed by the spread of Eurasian diseases, Eurasian people, and the world economy.},

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible ” betweenness” measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

    abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting communities or modules in networks, groups of vertices with a higher-than-average density of edges connecting them. Previous work indicates that a robust approach to this problem is the maximization of the benefit function known as “modularity” over possible divisions of a network. Here we show that this maximization process can be written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix we call the modularity matrix, which plays a role in com- munity detection similar to that played by the graph Laplacian in graph partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a new centrality measure that identifies those vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong. The algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with applications to a variety of real-world complex networks.},

    abstract = {«The Natural System» is the name given to the underlying arrangement present in the diversity of life. Unlike a classification, which is made up of classes and members, a system or arrangement is an integrated whole made up of connected parts. In the pre-evolutionary period a variety of forms were proposed for the Natural System, including maps, circles, stars, and abstract multidimensional objects. The trees sketched by Darwin in the 1830s should probably be considered the first genuine evolutionary diagrams of the Natural System—the first genuine evolutionary trees. Darwin refined his image of the Natural System in the well-known evolutionary tree published in the Origin of Species, where he also carefully distinguished between arrangements and classifications. Following the publication of the Origin, there was a great burst of evolutionary tree building, but interest in trees declined substantially after 1900, only to be revived in recent years with the development of cladistic analysis. While evolutionary trees are modern diagrams of the Natural System, they are at the same time instances of another broad class of diagrams that may be called «trees of history»: branching diagrams of genealogical descent and change. During the same years that Darwin was sketching his first evolutionary trees, the earliest examples of two other trees of history also appeared: the first trees of language evolution and of manuscript genealogy. Though these were apparently independent of evolutionary trees in their origin, the similarities among all these trees of history, and among the historical processes that underlie them, were soon recognized. Darwin compared biological evolution and language evolution several times in the Origin of Species, and both Ernst Haeckel and the linguist August Schleicher made similar comparisons. Both linguists and stemmaticists (students of manuscript descent) understood the principle of apomorphy—the principle that only shared innovations provide evidence of common ancestry—more clearly than did systematists, and if there had been more cross-fertilization among these fields the cladistic revolution in systematics might well have taken place in the nineteenth century. Although historical linguists and stemmaticists have in some respects had sounder theory than have systematists, at least until recently, they have also had the practical problem of very large amounts of data, a problem not often faced by systematists until the advent of molecular sequencing. The opportunity now exists for systematists to contribute to the theory and practice of linguistics and stemmatics, their sister disciplines in historical reconstruction, through application of our commonly used computer programs for tree estimation. Preliminary results from the application of numerical cladistic analysis to a large stemmatic data set have been very encouraging, and have already generated much discussion in the stemmatics community.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT Some adaptationist explanations are regarded as maximally solid and others fanciful just-so stories. Just-so stories are explanations based on very little evidence. Lack of evidence leads to circular-sounding reasoning: “this trait was shaped by selection in unseen ancestral populations and this selection must have occurred because the trait is present.” Well-supported adaptationist explanations include evidence that is not only abundant but selected from comparative, populational, and optimality perspectives, the three adaptationist subdisciplines. Each subdiscipline obtains its broad relevance in evolutionary biology via assumptions that can only be tested with the methods of the other subdisciplines. However, even in the best-supported explanations, assumptions regarding variation, heritability, and fitness in unseen ancestral populations are always present. These assumptions are accepted given how well they would explain the data if they were true. This means that some degree of “circularity” is present in all evolutionary explanations. Evolutionary explanation corresponds not to a deductive structure, as biologists usually assert, but instead to ones such as abduction or Bayesianism. With these structures in mind, we show the way to a healthier view of “circularity” in evolutionary biology and why integration across the comparative, populational, and optimality approaches is necessary.},

    abstract = {The Himalaya and surrounding regions are amongst the world's most linguistically diverse places. Of an estimated 600 languages spoken here at Asia's heart, few are researched in depth and many virtually undocumented. Historical developments and relationships between the region's languages also remain poorly understood. Thisbook brings together new work on under-researched Himalayan languages with investigations into the complexities of the area's linguistic history, offering original data and perspectives on the synchrony and diachrony of the Greater Himalayan Region. The volume arises from papers given and topics discussed at the 16th Himalayan Languages Symposium in London in 2010. Most papers focus on Tibeto-Burman languages. These include topics relating to individual - mostly small and endangered - languages, such as Tilung, Shumcho, Rengmitca, Yongning Na and Tshangla; comparative research on the Tibetic, East Bodish and Tamangic language groups; and several papers whose scope covers the whole language family. The remaining paper deals with the origins of Burushaski, whose genetic affiliation remains uncertain. This book will be of special interest to scholars of Tibeto-Burman, and historical as well as general linguists.},

    abstract = {We describe a Bayesian method for investigating correlated evolution of discrete binary traits on phylogenetic trees. The method fits a continuous‐time Markov model to a pair of traits, seeking the best fitting models that describe their joint evolution on a phylogeny. We employ the methodology of reversible‐jump (RJ) Markov chain Monte Carlo to search among the large number of possible models, some of which conform to independent evolution of the two traits, others to correlated evolution. The RJ Markov chain visits these models in proportion to their posterior probabilities, thereby directly estimating the support for the hypothesis of correlated evolution. In addition, the RJ Markov chain simultaneously estimates the posterior distributions of the rate parameters of the model of trait evolution. These posterior distributions can be used to test among alternative evolutionary scenarios to explain the observed data. All results are integrated over a sample of phylogenetic trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty. We implement the method in a program called RJ Discrete and illustrate it by analyzing the question of whether mating system and advertisement of estrus by females have coevolved in the Old World monkeys and great apes.},

Combined with statistical methods borrowed from evolutionary biology, this Darwinian perspective has brought new opportunities to the study of the evolution of human languages. These include the statistical inference of phylogenetic trees of languages, the study of how linguistic traits evolve over thousands of years of language change, the reconstruction of ancestral or proto-languages, and using language change to date historical events.},

    volume = {10},
    number = {131},
    year = {2010},
    abstract = {Background Maximum parsimony is one of the most commonly used criteria for reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Recently, Nakhleh and co-workers extended this criterion to enable reconstruction of phylogenetic networks, and demonstrated its application to detecting reticulate evolutionary relationships. However, one of the major problems with this extension has been that it favors more complex evolutionary relationships over simpler ones, thus having the potential for overestimating the amount of reticulation in the data. An ad hoc solution to this problem that has been used entails inspecting the improvement in the parsimony length as more reticulation events are added to the model, and stopping when the improvement is below a certain threshold. Results In this paper, we address this problem in a more systematic way, by proposing a nonparametric bootstrap-based measure of support of inferred reticulation events, and using it to determine the number of those events, as well as their placements. A number of samples is generated from the given sequence alignment, and reticulation events are inferred based on each sample. Finally, the support of each reticulation event is quantified based on the inferences made over all samples. Conclusions We have implemented our method in the NEPAL software tool (available publicly at http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/ webcite), and studied its performance on both biological and simulated data sets. While our studies show very promising results, they also highlight issues that are inherently challenging when applying the maximum parsimony criterion to detect reticulate evolution.},

Thanks to major advances in genomic studies it has now become clear that this mechanism contributed significantly to the evolution of novel biological functions in different evolutionary lineages. Analyses of completely sequenced bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic genomes has revealed that modular assembly of novel constituents of various eukaryotic intracellular signalling pathways played a major role in the evolution of eukaryotes. Comparison of the genomes of single-celled eukaryotes, multicellular plants and animals has also shown that the evolution of multicellularity was accompanied by the assembly of numerous novel extracellular matrix proteins and extracellular signalling proteins that are absolutely essential for multicellularity. There is now strong evidence that exon-shuffling played a general role in the assembly of the modular proteins involved in extracellular communications of metazoa. Although some of these proteins seem to be shared by all major groups of metazoa, others are restricted to certain evolutionary lineages. The genomic features of the chordates appear to have favoured intronic recombination as evidenced by the fact that exon-shuffling continued to be a major source of evolutionary novelty during vertebrate evolution.},

First, we hypothesise a relationship between expectation and grouping in auditory perception, and introduce a novel information-theoretic model of perceptual segmentation to test the hypothesis. Although we apply the model to musical melody, it is applicable in principle to sequential grouping in other areas of cognition. Second, we address a methodological consideration in the analysis of ambiguous stimuli that produce different percepts between individuals. We propose and demonstrate a solution to this problem, based on clustering of participants prior to analysis. Third, we conduct the first comparative analysis of probabilistic-learning and rule-based models of perceptual grouping in music. In spite of having only unsupervised exposure to music, the model performs comparably to rule-based models based on expert musical knowledge, supporting a role for probabilistic learning in perceptual segmentation of music.},

We show that 3.5–4.5 year olds are able to predictively compose two novel functions at significantly above chance levels, even without any explicit training or feedback on the composition itself. We take this as evidence that children at this age possess some capacity for compositionality, consistent with models that make this ability explicit, and providing an empirical challenge to those that do not.</p>},

Ces formes reconstruites, si elles apparaissent dans deux ou dans plusieurs diverses traditions et ne sont pas surgies indépendemment dans chacune d'elles, constituent des isoglosses qui en partie sont dues à des relatiobs entre parlers i.-e. postérieurement à la dissolution de l'unité primitive, en partie remontent à cette unité. Mais les secondes ne nous donnent pas le tableau d'un système linguistique rigidement un (comme p. ex. le latin classique), dont on puisse partir pour atteindre les origines ultimes de l'i.-e. (racines monosyllabiques, etc.): ce sont là des phantaisies qui se réclament des théories de Schleicher, fondées sur une vision de la langue comme organisme naturel. L'indo-européen est un phénomène historique comparable au “latin vulgaire”; comme celui-ci n'est pas une langue unique, mass un ensemble de dialectes réunis par des isoglosses partielles ou totales et au fond une “ligue linguistique” née de la rencontre de langues diverses qui en ont déterminé l'aspect général et les traits locaux, ainsi on devra penser de l'indo-européen, dans qui, comme le latin de Rome a donné la partie la plus importante et substantielle des traits propres aux dialectes du “latin vulgaire”, une des langues qui y sont confluées (peut-être une phase plus ancienne du sanskrit) peut avoir fourm le schéma fondamental et une bonne partie des formes, qui suivant les régions ont pu être acceptées dans une mesure plus ou moins large. Notre tâche est précisément de chercher à rétablir les variétés de l'unité i.-e. et de retracer les lignes fondamentales selon qui cette unité relative s'est constituée, non de façonner un “indo-européen” d'une seule pièce, qui est un postulat indémontrable.},

A method of analysis for historical biogeography. Syst. Zool. 27:1-16.-Historical explanations of biotic distribution fall into two classes, dispersal explanations and vicariance explanations. Dispersal models explain disjunctions by dispersal across pre-existing barriers, vicariance models by the appearance of barriers fragmenting the ranges of ancestral species. Distributional data seem insufficient to resolve decisively either dispersal or vicariance as the cause of particular allopatric distribution patterns. When faced with such a pattern our first question should therefore be directed not to its cause, but to whether or not it conforms to a general pattern of relationships shown by taxa endemic to the areas occupied. Two-taxon statements are always compatible with a general pattern; three-taxon statements are therefore the most basic possible units of biogeographic (as well as phylogenetic) analysis. Analysis of three-taxon statements involves converting a hypothesis about the interrelationships of taxa (a cladogram indicating relative recency of common ancestry) to one concerning the interrelationships of areas (a cladogram indicating relative recency of common ancestral biotas). The generality of the area hypothesis may be tested by comparison with other groups endemic to the relevant areas. If the area hypothesis is corroborated as general, a statement of the relative recency of interconnections among areas is obtained, and evidence from historical geology may allow us to specify the nature of those interconnections and thereby the cause of those distributions that conform to the general pattern. Analysis of four-taxon statements indicates that the availability of structurally different patterns and of groups that can serve as adequate tests of the generality of those patterns increases with the addition of taxa to the hypothesis, and that neither extinction nor the failure of some groups to respond (by speciating) to given dispersal or vicariance events interferes with the analysis.},

Dichotomous cladograms can be preferred simply on the basis of their maximal information content, without reference to speciation mechanisms. Because only the interrelationships of diagnosable taxa (those with unique sets of apomorphic characters) can be investigated, questions about whether speciation can occur without branching, or whether species become extinct at branching points, are irrelevant to cladistic practice. The distinction between plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states depends not on the reconstruction of actual evolutionary history, but on the discrimination of more general from less general characters; groups based on plesiomorphy are defined by the absence of characters and are therefore artificial. Hence cladistic methods are not the methods of phylogenetics per se, but the methods of natural classification in general; phylogenetic conclusions are an extrapolation from hypotheses about natural order.},

    abstract = {Explaining the variation between human languages and the constraints on that variation is a core goal of linguistics. In the last 20 y, it has been claimed that many striking universals of cross-linguistic variation follow from a hypothetical principle that dependency length-the distance between syntactically related words in a sentence-is minimized. Various models of human sentence production and comprehension predict that long dependencies are difficult or inefficient to process; minimizing dependency length thus enables effective communication without incurring processing difficulty. However, despite widespread application of this idea in theoretical, empirical, and practical work, there is not yet large-scale evidence that dependency length is actually minimized in real utterances across many languages; previous work has focused either on a small number of languages or on limited kinds of data about each language. Here, using parsed corpora of 37 diverse languages, we show that overall dependency lengths for all languages are shorter than conservative random baselines. The results strongly suggest that dependency length minimization is a universal quantitative property of human languages and support explanations of linguistic variation in terms of general properties of human information processing.},

    abstract = {<p>Historical linguistics aims at inferring the most likely language phylogenetic tree starting from information concerning the evolutionary relatedness of languages. The available information are typically lists of homologous (lexical, phonological, syntactic) features or characters for many different languages: a set of parallel corpora whose compilation represents a paramount achievement in linguistics.</p> <p>From this perspective the reconstruction of language trees is an example of inverse problems: starting from present, incomplete and often noisy, information, one aims at inferring the most likely past evolutionary history. A fundamental issue in inverse problems is the evaluation of the inference made. A standard way of dealing with this question is to generate data with artificial models in order to have full access to the evolutionary process one is going to infer. This procedure presents an intrinsic limitation: when dealing with real data sets, one typically does not know which model of evolution is the most suitable for them. A possible way out is to compare algorithmic inference with expert classifications. This is the point of view we take here by conducting a thorough survey of the accuracy of reconstruction methods as compared with the Ethnologue expert classifications. We focus in particular on state-of-the-art <italic>distance-based</italic> methods for phylogeny reconstruction using worldwide linguistic databases.</p> <p>In order to assess the accuracy of the inferred trees we introduce and characterize two generalizations of standard definitions of distances between trees. Based on these scores we quantify the relative performances of the distance-based algorithms considered. Further we quantify how the completeness and the coverage of the available databases affect the accuracy of the reconstruction. Finally we draw some conclusions about where the accuracy of the reconstructions in historical linguistics stands and about the leading directions to improve it.</p>},

    abstract = {The paper deals with certain key aspects of the procedure of establishing long-range genetic relationship between languages in the absence of a classic step-by-step reconstruction, such as: 1) the issue of establishing the randomness threshold for lexical matches on the Swadesh 100­item wordlist, depending on the particularities of the employed algorithm; 2) the issue of stability ranking in the sphere of the basic lexicon; 3) the issue of multiple isolated roots that do not find any parallels in the other languages of the family. These general topics are discussed in the context of specific problems that arise during research on the genetic classification of Atlantic languages. The latter are traditionally considered to constitute a branch of the Niger-Congo macrofamily, but lexicostatistics suggests that their date of separation is no younger than 8000 . Two critical responses to the paper present further opinions on the difficult problematics of establishing long-range relationship; the author’s final response is also to be regarded as an important constituent of the published paper. В статье рассматриваются некоторые ключевые проблемы установления дальнего родства языков в условиях, когда отсутствует классическая ступенчатая реконструкция, а именно: 1) проблема установления порога случайных сходств в стословном списке Сводеша (при различных алгоритмах их фиксации); 2) проблема ранжирования базисной лексики по ее устойчивости; 3) проблема многочисленных изолированных корней, не находящих параллелей в других языках семьи. Эти общие сюжеты рассматриваются на основе конкретной проблематики построения генетической классификации атлантических языков. Атлантические языки традиционно считаются одной из ветвей нигеро-конголезской макросемьи, но при этом лексикостатистика говорит о том, что дата их разделения составляет не менее 8000 лет. Публикуемые два критических отзыва на статью в определенном смысле явяются ее продолжением, развивая сложную проблематику установления дальнего родства языков; авторский ответ на эти отзывы следует также рассматривать как важный фрагмент публикуемой статьи.},

    abstract = {In making an argument for the antiquity of language, based on comparative evidence, Dediu & Levinson (2013) express hope that some combinations of structural features will prove so conservative that they will allow deep linguistic reconstruction. I propose that the earliest stages of syntax/grammar as reconstructed in Progovac (2015a), based on a theoretical and data-driven linguistic analysis, provide just such a conservative platform, which would have been commanded also by Neandertals and the common ancestor. I provide a fragment of this proto-grammar, which includes flat verb-noun compounds used for naming and insult (e.g. rattle-snake, cry-baby, scatter-brain), and paratactic (loose) combinations of such flat structures (e.g. Come one, come all; You seek, you find). This flat, binary, paratactic platform is found in all languages, and can be shown to serve as foundation for any further structure building. However, given the degree and nature of variation across languages in elaborating syntax beyond this proto-stage, I propose that hierarchical syntax did not emerge once and uniformly in all its complexity, but rather multiple times, either within Africa, or after dispersion from Africa. If so, then, under the uniregional hypothesis, our common ancestor with Neandertals, H. heidelbergensis, could not have commanded hierarchical syntax, but “only” the proto-grammar. Linguistic reconstructions of this kind are necessary for formulating precise and testable hypotheses regarding language evolution. In addition to the hominin timeline, this reconstruction can also engage, and negotiate between, the fields of neuroscience and genetics, as I illustrate with one specific scenario involving FOXP2 gene.},

    abstract = {:It is well-known that Charles Darwin sketched abstract trees of relationship in his 1837 notebook, and depicted a tree in the Origin of Species (1859). Here I attempt to place Darwin's trees in historical context. By the mid-Eighteenth century the Great Chain of Being was increasingly seen to be an inadequate description of order in nature, and by about 1780 it had been largely abandoned without a satisfactory alternative having been agreed upon. In 1750 Donati described aquatic and terrestrial organisms as forming a network, and a few years later Buffon depicted a network of genealogical relationships among breeds of dogs. In 1764 Bonnet asked whether the Chain might actually branch at certain points, and in 1766 Pallas proposed that the gradations among organisms resemble a tree with a compound trunk, perhaps not unlike the tree of animal life later depicted by Eichwald. Other trees were presented by Augier in 1801 and by Lamarck in 1809 and 1815, the latter two assuming a transmutation of species over time. Elaborate networks of affinities among plants and among animals were depicted in the late Eighteenth and very early Nineteenth centuries. In the two decades immediately prior to 1837, so-called affinities and/or analogies among organisms were represented by diverse geometric figures. Series of plant and animal fossils in successive geological strata were represented as trees in a popular textbook from 1840, while in 1858 Bronn presented a system of animals, as evidenced by the fossil record, in a form of a tree. Darwin's 1859 tree and its subsequent elaborations by Haeckel came to be accepted in many but not all areas of biological sciences, while network diagrams were used in others. Beginning in the early 1960s trees were inferred from protein and nucleic acid sequences, but networks were re-introduced in the mid-1990s to represent lateral genetic transfer, increasingly regarded as a fundamental mode of evolution at least for bacteria and archaea. In historical context, then, the Network of Life preceded the Tree of Life and might again supersede it.REVIEWERS:This article was reviewed by Eric Bapteste, Patrick Forterre and Dan Graur.},

    abstract = {The studies in this book represent the rich, diverse and substantial research being conducted today in the linguistics of Mainland Southeast Asia. The chapters cover a broad scope. Several studies address questions of language relatedness, often challenging conventional assumptions about the status of language contact as an explanatory factor in accounting for linguistic similarities. Several address the question of Mainland Southeast Asia as a linguistic area, exploring new ways to imagine and define the boundaries, and indeed the boundedness, of a Mainland Southeast Asia area. Two contributions rethink the received notion of the 'sesquisyllable' with new empirical and theoretical angles. And a set of chapters explores topics in the morphology and syntax of the region's languages, sometimes challenging orthodox assumptions and claims about what a typical language of Mainland Southeast Asia is like. Written by leading researchers in the field, and with a substantial overview of current knowledge and new directions by the volume editors N. J. Enfield and Bernard Comrie, this book will serve as an authoritative source on where the linguistics of Mainland Southeast Asia is at, and where it is heading.},

    abstract = {The claim that Eskimo languages have words for different types of snow is well-known among the public, but has been greatly exaggerated through popularization and is therefore viewed with skepticism by many scholars of language. Despite the prominence of this claim, to our knowledge the line of reasoning behind it has not been tested broadly across languages. Here, we note that this reasoning is a special case of the more general view that language is shaped by the need for efficient communication, and we empirically test a variant of it against multiple sources of data, including library reference works, Twitter, and large digital collections of linguistic and meteorological data. Consistent with the hypothesis of efficient communication, we find that languages that use the same linguistic form for snow and ice tend to be spoken in warmer climates, and that this association appears to be mediated by lower communicative need to talk about snow and ice. Our results confirm that variation in semantic categories across languages may be traceable in part to local communicative needs. They suggest moreover that despite its awkward history, the topic of “words for snow” may play a useful role as an accessible instance of the principle that language supports efficient communication.},

However, the most widely used phylogenetic models only account for residue substitution events. We describe a probabilistic model of a multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree, using a rate matrix augmented by the gap character. Starting from a continuous Markov process, we construct a non-reversible generative (birth-death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions. The model assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. We apply this model to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip. Using standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new "concordance test" benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments, we show that the extended program dnamlepsilon improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm.},

    abstract = {This paper discusses the maximum robustness approach for studying cases of adaptation in language. We live in age where we have more data on more languages than ever before, and more data to link it with from other domains. This should make it easier to test hypotheses involving adaptation, and also to spot new patterns that might be explained by adaptation. However, there is not much discussion of the overall approach to research in this area. There are outstanding questions about how to formalise theories, what the criteria are for directing research and how to integrate results from different methods into a clear assessment of a hypothesis. This paper addresses some of those issues by suggesting an approach which is causal, incremental and robust. It illustrates the approach with reference to a recent claim that dry environments select against the use of precise contrasts in pitch. Study 1 replicates a previous analysis of the link between humidity and lexical tone with an alternative dataset and finds that it is not robust. Study 2 performs an analysis with a continuous measure of tone and finds no significant correlation. Study 3 addresses a more recent analysis of the link between humidity and vowel use and finds that it is robust, though the effect size is small and the measurement robustness is only moderate. Methodological robustness of the hypothesis is addressed by suggesting additional approaches including iterated learning, a historical case study, corpus studies and studying individual speech.},

All current models of this ambiguity advantage assume that it is the presence of multiple unrelated meanings that produce this benefit. A set of three lexical decision experiments reported here challenge this assumption. We contrast the ambiguity seen in words like bark, which have multiple unrelated meanings, with words that have multiple related word senses (e.g., twist). In all three experiments we find that while multiple word senses do produce faster responses, ambiguity between multiple meanings delays recognition. These results suggest that, while competition between the multiple meanings of ambiguous words delays their recognition, the rich semantic representations associated with words with many senses facilitate their recognition.},

    abstract = {Abstract There exist striking resemblances in the stories of ethnolinguistic groups separated by vast geographic distances, with nearby groups having the most in common. The causes of these geographic associations are uncertain. Here we use method and theory from population genetics to examine cultural transmission in folktale inventories of 18 hunter–gatherer groups spread across 6000 km of Siberia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. We find that linguistic relatedness and geographic proximity independently predict overlap in folktale inventories, which provides evidence for both vertical transmission down cultural lineages and horizontal transmission between groups. These results suggest that high-bandwidth social learning across group boundaries is a feature of traditional hunter–gatherers, which may help explain how complex cultural traditions can develop and be retained in ostensibly small groups.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research has highlighted psycholinguistic variables influencing naming ability for individuals with aphasia, including: familiarity, frequency, age of acquisition, imageability, operativity, and length () and a potential link between typicality and generalisation to untreated items in intervention (). However, the effect of concept typicality (the extent to which an item can be considered a prototype of a category) on naming in aphasia warrants further examination. AIMS: To investigate first whether typicality can be reliably rated across a range of natural semantic categories and second whether, and if so in which direction, typicality influences naming performance for people with aphasia. To provide quantitative and qualitative information on typicality for a set of stimuli for use in future research. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Typicality ratings were obtained and the results compared with those in the existing literature. The influence of typicality on picture naming was investigated employing both matched sets (high and low typicality matched for other psycholinguistic variables) and logistic regression analyses for the group and individual participants with aphasia (n = 20). OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Typicality rating correlated strongly with ratings obtained in previous research (: r = .798, N = 35, p \textless .001; : r = .844, N = 47, p \textless .001). Typicality was a significant predictor of picture naming for the group and some individuals, with generally better performance for typical items. This was demonstrated in both matched sets and regression analyses. However, other psycholinguistic variables proved more strongly related to naming success, particularly age of acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Typicality can be rated reliably and should be considered alongside other psycholinguistic variables when investigating word retrieval and intervention in aphasia. Further research is necessary to accurately model the direction of typicality effects found in word retrieval. Finally, the differing nature, size, and internal structure of categories require further exploration when investigating typicality effects.},

The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of >6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network-including physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine-information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences.},

This article offers an automated method that can highlight blend splinters which have the potential to become morphemes in their own right. For instance, the word alcoholic has given rise a large number of blends such as workaholic or rageaholic, so that the splinter -holic is now recognized as a morpheme in the Oxford English Dictionary Misc. Because of the sheer number of newly coined blends, it is difficult to identify splinters that are turning into morphemes on the sole basis of human observation. It would therefore be desirable to have an automated method that could process large amounts of data and identify such elements. This article develops such a method, relying on unsupervised morphological segmentation (Harris, 1955). A custom blend database was established for this purpose. The method is able to detect splinters mentioned in previous research, such as -tainment, -ercise, and cyber-, but in addition, it also detects elements that have not been discussed so far, including -tastic, -sumer, and -verse.},

    abstract = {Strongest evidence (SE) is an approach to evaluating the support provided by characters for alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (i.e., trees). Although first demonstrated in the context of parsimony, SE is equally applicable to compatibility analysis. In the logic of strongest evidence, a character that is compatible with a phylogenetic hypothesis supports the tree only to the degree at which this compatibility would be improbable under a model of cladistic dissociation between character state distribution and the tree. The support measure derived from this consideration is called the "apparent phylogenetic signal" (APS). The total support for a tree is the sum of the individual character APS values. Tree topology and character structure both affect the chance of "random" compatibility and thus the APS scores. Because a clique of compatible characters implies a specific tree (possibly more than one if the character states are unordered or there are missing data), the evidential strength of a clique may be measured as the SE support for the clique's tree by the clique's characters. Use of this measure is demonstrated on a morphological data set for North American species of Chloris (Poaceae). Cliques with the same number of characters vary tremendously in their apparent evidential quality. The strongest clique is nearly 100,000 times less likely to be compatible by chance with the tree it implies than is the weakest clique of the same size. This approach to clique evaluation is compared with character counting and Meacham's clique improbability measure.},

    year = {2009},
    abstract = {This is an investigation about linguistic diversity, examining its decline in different societal conditions over the last century, and interrogating claims in language policy and planning to be ‘protecting linguistic diversity’, using the UK as its main example. Chapter 1 comprises a review of variationist sociolinguistics, showing how it has never fully defined linguistic diversity. Adjustments are suggested, and a working definition of linguistic diversity offered. Chapter 2 presents data from two major nationwide dialect surveys, in 1889 and 1962, showing how local dialects were weakening in this period. The main focus is declining diversity, but information is presented about possible conditioning factors, primarily increases in literacy. In the absence of such nationwide reports after 1962, Chapter 3 collates individual dialect studies from two regions of England, the northeast and southeast, describing dialect convergence across these large geographical areas. These changes are contrasted to those reported in Chapter 2. Again the main theme is declining diversity, but information is reviewed to help explain these contrasts, primarily increases in geographical mobility in the latter half of the 20th century, concentrated around these regions. Chapter 4 examines dialect weakening that some researchers have attributed, at least in part, to the media. This also represents a change in societal conditions undergirding declining diversity. Some theoretical work is done to distinguish such changes from those observed in Chapter 3. Chapter 5 reviews the rhetoric of minority language policy and planning, and its frequent and explicit claims to be ‘protecting linguistic diversity’. The insights developed in Chapters 1-4 are applied to two modern UK language revivals, Cornish and Welsh, to see how diversity overall is faring here. The conclusion sums up the gaps in our thinking about linguistic diversity, and clarifies the limitations of planned interventions upon language.},

    abstract = {The figwort genus Scrophularia (Scrophulariaceae), widespread across the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, comprises about 250 species and is a taxonomically challenging lineage displaying large morphological and chromosomal diversity. Scrophularia has never been examined in a large-scale phylogenetic and biogeographic context and represents a useful model for studying evolutionary history in the context of reticulation. A comprehensively sampled phylogeny of Scrophularia was constructed, based on nuclear ribosomal (ITS) and plastid DNA sequences (trnQ-rps16 intergenic spacer, trnL-trnF region) of 147 species, using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood approaches. Selected individuals were cloned. A combination of coding plastid indels and ITS intra-individual site polymorphisms, and applying Neighbor-Net and consensus network methods for adequate examination of within-dataset uncertainty as well as among-dataset incongruence, was used to disentangle phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore, divergence time estimation and ancestral area reconstruction were performed to infer the biogeographic history of the genus. The analyses reveal significant plastid-nuclear marker incongruence and considerable amounts of intra-individual nucleotide polymorphism in the ITS dataset. This is due to a combination of processes including reticulation and incomplete lineage sorting, possibly complicated by inter-array heterogeneity and pseudogenization in ITS in the presence of incomplete concerted evolution. Divergence time estimates indicate that Scrophularia originated during the Miocene in Southwestern Asia, its primary center of diversity. From there, the genus spread to Eastern Asia, the New World, Europe, Northern Africa, and other regions. Hybridization and polyploidy played a key role in the diversification history of Scrophularia, which was shaped by allopatric speciation in mountainous habitats during different climatic periods.},

Each category exemplar in the database was collected empirically in an exemplar generation study. For each category exemplar, norms for semantic typicality, estimated age of acquisition, and concept familiarity were gathered in three different rating studies. Reliability data and additional analyses on effects of semantic category and intercorrelations between age of acquisition, semantic typicality, concept familiarity, word length, and word frequency are provided. Overall, the data show high inter- and intrastudy reliabilities, providing a new resource tool for designing experiments with German word materials. The full database is available in the supplementary material of this file and also at www.psychonomic.org/archive .},

    abstract = {Many drum communication systems around the world transmit information by emulating tonal and rhythmic patterns of spoken languages in sequences of drumbeats. Their rhythmic characteristics, in particular, have not been systematically studied so far, although understanding them represents a rare occasion for providing an original insight into the basic units of speech rhythm as selected by natural speech practices directly based on beats. Here, we analyse a corpus of Bora drum communication from the northwest Amazon, which is nowadays endangered with extinction. We show that four rhythmic units are encoded in the length of pauses between beats. We argue that these units correspond to vowel-to-vowel intervals with different numbers of consonants and vowel lengths. By contrast, aligning beats with syllables, mora or only vowel length yields inconsistent results. Moreover, we also show that Bora drummed messages conventionally select rhythmically distinct markers to further distinguish words. The two phonological tones represented in drummed speech encode only few lexical contrasts. Rhythm thus appears to crucially contribute to the intelligibility of drummed Bora. Our study provides novel evidence for the role of rhythmic structures composed of vowel-to-vowel intervals in the complex puzzle concerning the redundancy and distinctiveness of acoustic features embedded in speech.},

    abstract = {Phylogenetic trees can be reconstructed from the matrix which contains the distances between all pairs of languages in a family. Recently, we proposed a new method which uses normalized Levenshtein distances among words with the same meaning and averages over all the items of a given list. Decisions about the number of items in the input lists for language comparison have been debated since the beginning of glottochronology. The point is that words associated with some of the meanings have a rapid lexical evolution. Therefore, a large vocabulary comparison is only apparently more accurate than a smaller one, since many of the words do not carry any useful information. In principle, one should find the optimal length of the input lists, studying the stability of the different items. In this paper we tackle the problem with an automated methodology based only on our normalized Levenshtein distance. With this approach, the program of an automated reconstruction of language relationships is completed.},

From a technical point of view the program consists in extracting from the genetic/lexical distances a set of reconstructed geographical positions to be compared with the real ones. We show that geographical recovering is successful when the genetic/lexical distances are not a simple consequence of phylogenesis but also of horizontal transfers as, for example, vocabulary borrowings between different languages. Our results go well beyond the simple observation that geographical distances and genetic/lexical distances are correlated. The ascertainment of a correlation, in our perspective, merely is a prerequisite.},

    abstract = {Ancient population expansions and dispersals often leave enduring signatures in the cultural traditions of their descendants, as well as in their genes and languages. The international folktale record has long been regarded as a rich context in which to explore these legacies. To date, investigations in this area have been complicated by a lack of historical data and the impact of more recent waves of diffusion. In this study, we introduce new methods for tackling these problems by applying comparative phylogenetic methods and autologistic modelling to analyse the relationships between folktales, population histories and geographical distances in Indo-European-speaking societies. We find strong correlations between the distributions of a number of folktales and phylogenetic, but not spatial, associations among populations that are consistent with vertical processes of cultural inheritance. Moreover, we show that these oral traditions probably originated long before the emergence of the literary record, and find evidence that one tale (\textquoteleftThe Smith and the Devil\textquoteright) can be traced back to the Bronze Age. On a broader level, the kinds of stories told in ancestral societies can provide important insights into their culture, furnishing new perspectives on linguistic, genetic and archaeological reconstructions of human prehistory.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

    abstract = {Phylogenetic systematics is an increasingly popular tool in historical linguistics for reconstructing the evolutionary histories of groups of languages. One problem in apply- ing phylogenetic methods to languages is that phylogenetic methods assume evolu- tion takes place strictly by descent with modification, whereas borrowing between languages is common. This paper tests two different methods for addressing bor- rowing in phylogenetic analysis of language on a dataset representing the dialects of ancient Greek: character weighting and preliminary cluster analysis. Both methods show promise; they correctly recovered the subgrouping of the Greek dialects and were able to improve the resolution of the tree compared to the preliminary analysis. How- ever, they recovered conflicting subgroupings of the West Greek dialects. This result is most likely due to a circular dialect continuum within West Greek. Using phylogenetic methods in situations which match their assumptions is crucial; for the West Greek dialects, phylogenetic network methods would be more appropriate.},

Here, we present a draft genome sequence from a 35,000-year-old wolf from the Taimyr Peninsula in northern Siberia. We find that this individual belonged to a population that diverged from the common ancestor of present-day wolves and dogs very close in time to the appearance of the domestic dog lineage. We use the directly dated ancient wolf genome to recalibrate the molecular timescale of wolves and dogs and find that the mutation rate is substantially slower than assumed by most previous studies, suggesting that the ancestors of dogs were separated from present-day wolves before the Last Glacial Maximum. We also find evidence of introgression from the archaic Taimyr wolf lineage into present-day dog breeds from northeast Siberia and Greenland, contributing between 1.4% and 27.3% of their ancestry. This demonstrates that the ancestry of present-day dogs is derived from multiple regional wolf populations.},

    abstract = {Multistate morphological characters have generally been treated as either "unordered" or "ordered" in phylogenetic analyses using parsimony Because ordering relations do not apply to the states of characters treated under these methods, I prefer "maximally connected" character to "unordered" character and "minimally connected" character to "ordered" character. This paper formally defines the two character types, compares their properties, and considers the consequences of the two methods for both resolution and congruence. The results demonstrate that minimally connected characters increase resolution relative to maximally connected characters. Minimally connected characters do not, however, necessarily increase congruence among data sets. Because both methods produce nonrandom congruence among data sets, both character types constitute valid phylogenetic methods. A mixed-parsimony approach is advocated, wherein multistate characters are treated as minimally connected whenever reasonable but treated as maximally connected otherwise.},

In brief, he calculated that the number of possible amino-acid sequences is greater by many orders of magnitude than the number of proteins which could have existed on Earth since the origin of life, and hence that functionally effective proteins have a vanishingly small chance of arising by mutation. Natural selection is therefore ineffective because it lacks the essential raw material—favourable mutations.},

However, biological and practical considerations require the exploration of other models. Here, we address a problem concerning the representation of conflicting and partially overlapping datasets in phylogenetics. We examine the problem of aligning many source trees from independent phylogenetic analyses into a structure that can be analyzed and synthesized but retain all of the original structure and source information. We present methods to map trees into a common graph structure using a graph database. This allows the information in the trees to be stored and synthesized in several ways. Specifically, we demonstrate how these graphs can be used to construct enormous trees as an alternative to labor-intensive grafting exercise and other methods that make the synthetic tree difficult to update. We also show how examination of the relationships in the graph allows patterns to emerge concerning support and information that are difficult to discern with existing methods. Because these methods scale well into the millions of nodes, these techniques should lead to the construction and maintenance of even larger phylogenies and new techniques for analyzing graphs that maintain the structure of the underlying trees.</p>},

Here we reconstruct the gene content of ancestral Archaea and Proteobacteria and quantify the processes connecting them to their present day representatives based on the distribution of genes in completely sequenced genomes. We estimate that the ancestor of the Proteobacteria contained around 2500 genes, and the ancestor of the Archaea around 2050 genes. Although it is necessary to invoke horizontal gene transfer to explain the content of present day genomes, gene loss, gene genesis, and simple vertical inheritance are quantitatively the most dominant processes in shaping the genome. Together they result in a turnover of gene content such that even the lineage leading from the ancestor of the Proteobacteria to the relatively large genome of Escherichia coli has lost at least 950 genes. Gene loss, unlike the other processes, correlates fairly well with time. This clock-like behavior suggests that gene loss is under negative selection, while the processes that add genes are under positive selection.},

It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms.

Here we present a set of norms for valence and arousal for a very large set of Spanish words, including items from a variety of frequencies, semantic categories, and parts of speech, including a subset of conjugated verbs. In this regard, we found that there were significant but very small differences between the ratings for conjugations of the same verb, validating the practice of applying the ratings for infinitives to all derived forms of the verb. Our norms show a high degree of reliability and are strongly correlated with those of Redondo, Fraga, Padrón, and Comesa\~na's (2007) Spanish version of the influential Affective Norms for English Words (Bradley & Lang, 1999), as well as those from Warriner, Kuperman, and Brysbaert (2013), the largest available set of emotional norms for English words. Additionally, we included measures of word prevalence--that is, the percentage of participants that knew a particular word--for each variable (Keuleers, Stevens, Mandera, & Brysbaert, 2015). Our large set of norms in Spanish not only will facilitate the creation of stimuli and the analysis of texts in that language, but also will be useful for cross-language comparisons and research on emotional aspects of bilingualism. The norms can be downloaded and available as a supplementary materials to this article.},

Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Γ yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets ≥4000 taxa it also runs 2–3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25 057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51 089 bp) taxa, respectively.Availability:icwww.epfl.ch/~stamatakContact:Alexandros.Stamatakis@epfl.chSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Convergence often results from similar genetic changes, which can emerge in two ways: the evolution of similar or identical mutations in independent lineages, which is termed parallel evolution; and the evolution in independent lineages of alleles that are shared among populations, which I call collateral genetic evolution. Evidence for parallel and collateral evolution has been found in many taxa, and an emerging hypothesis is that they result from the fact that mutations in some genetic targets minimize pleiotropic effects while simultaneously maximizing adaptation. If this proves correct, then the molecular changes underlying adaptation might be more predictable than has been appreciated previously.},

    abstract = {Homologous genes are classified into orthologs and paralogs, depending on whether they arose by speciation or duplication. It is widely assumed that orthologs share similar functions, whereas paralogs are expected to diverge more from each other. But does this assumption hold up on further examination? We present evidence that orthologs and paralogs are not so different in either their evolutionary rates or their mechanisms of divergence. We emphasize the importance of appropriately designed studies to test models of gene evolution between orthologs and between paralogs. Thus, functional change between orthologs might be as common as between paralogs, and future studies should be designed to test the impact of duplication against this alternative model.},

    abstract = {Previous work has shown that it is often essential to account for the variation in rates at different sites in phylogenetic models in order to avoid phylogenetic artifacts such as long branch attraction. In most current models, the gamma distribution is used for the rates-across-sites distributions and is implemented as an equal-probability discrete gamma. In this article, we introduce discrete distribution estimates with large numbers of equally spaced rate categories allowing us to investigate the appropriateness of the gamma model. With large numbers of rate categories, these discrete estimates are flexible enough to approximate the shape of almost any distribution. Likelihood ratio statistical tests and a nonparametric bootstrap confidence-bound estimation procedure based on the discrete estimates are presented that can be used to test the fit of a parametric family. We applied the methodology to several different protein data sets, and found that although the gamma model often provides a good parametric model for this type of data, rate estimates from an equal-probability discrete gamma model with a small number of categories will tend to underestimate the largest rates. In cases when the gamma model assumption is in doubt, rate estimates coming from the discrete rate distribution estimate with a large number of rate categories provide a robust alternative to gamma estimates. An alternative implementation of the gamma distribution is proposed that, for equal numbers of rate categories, is computationally more efficient during optimization than the standard gamma implementation and can provide more accurate estimates of site rates.},

    abstract = {The Chinese language has more native speakers than any other language, but research on the reading of Chinese characters is still not as well-developed as it is for the reading of words in alphabetic languages. Two areas notably lacking are the paucity of megastudies in Chinese and the relatively infrequent use of the lexical decision paradigm to investigate single-character recognition. The Chinese Lexicon Project, described in this article, is a database of lexical decision latencies for 2,500 Chinese single characters in simplified script, collected from a sample of native mainland Chinese (Mandarin) speakers (N = 35). This resource will provide a valuable adjunct to influential mega-databases, such as the English, French, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. Using two separate analyses, some advantages associated with megastudies are exemplified. These include the selection of the strongest measure to represent Chinese character frequency (Cai & Brysbaert's (PLoS ONE 5(6): e10729, 2010) subtitle contextual diversity frequency count), and the conducting of virtual studies to replicate and clarify existing findings. The unique morpho-syllabic nature of the Chinese writing system makes it a valuable case study for functional language contrasts. Moreover, this is the first publicly available large-scale repository of behavioral responses pertaining to Chinese language processing (the behavioral dataset is attached to this article, as a supplemental file available for download). For these reasons, the data should be of substantial interest to psychologists, linguists, and other researchers.},

    abstract = {This article reviews the various models that have been used to describe the relationships between gene trees and species trees. Molecular phylogeny has focused mainly on improving models for the reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alignments. Yet, most phylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species. Although the histories of genes and species are tightly linked, they are seldom identical, because genes duplicate, are lost or horizontally transferred, and because alleles can co-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events. Building models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can thus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known, and vice-versa. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one direction or the other, but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are known. Only a few studies have attempted to jointly infer gene trees and species trees. These models account for gene duplication and loss, transfer or incomplete lineage sorting. Some of them consider several types of events together, but none exists currently that considers the full repertoire of processes that generate gene trees along the species tree. Simulations as well as empirical studies on genomic data show that combining gene tree-species tree models with models of sequence evolution improves gene tree reconstruction. In turn, these better gene trees provide a more reliable basis for studying genome evolution or reconstructing ancestral chromosomes and ancestral gene sequences. We predict that gene tree-species tree methods that can deal with genomic data sets will be instrumental to advancing our understanding of genomic evolution.},

Against a baseline that communication variants spread in a population following neutral evolutionary dynamics (also known as drift models), we tested the role of two cultural selection models: coordination- and content-biased. We constructed a parametrized mixed probabilistic model of the spread of communicative variants in four 8-person laboratory micro-societies engaged in a simple communication game. We found that selectionist models, working in combination, explain the majority of the empirical data. The best-fitting parameter setting includes an egocentric bias and a content bias, suggesting that participants retained their own previously used communicative variants unless they encountered a superior (content-biased) variant, in which case it was adopted. This novel pattern of results suggests that (i) a theory of the cultural evolution of human communication systems must integrate selectionist models and (ii) human communication systems are functionally adaptive complex systems.},

    abstract = {Phylogenies, i.e., the evolutionary histories of groups of taxa, play a major role in representing the interrelationships among biological entities. Many software tools for reconstructing and evaluating such phylogenies have been proposed, almost all of which assume the underlying evolutionary history to be a tree. While trees give a satisfactory first-order approximation for many families of organisms, other families exhibit evolutionary mechanisms that cannot be represented by trees. Processes such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), hybrid speciation, and interspecific recombination, collectively referred to as reticulate evolutionary events, result in networks, rather than trees, of relationships. Various software tools have been recently developed to analyze reticulate evolutionary relationships, which include SplitsTree4, LatTrans, EEEP, HorizStory, and T-REX.\\ In this paper, we report on the PhyloNet software package, which is a suite of tools for analyzing reticulate evolutionary relationships, or evolutionary networks, which are rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, leaf-labeled by a set of taxa. These tools can be classified into four categories: (1) evolutionary network representation: reading/writing evolutionary networks in a newly devised compact form; (2) evolutionary network characterization: analyzing evolutionary networks in terms of three basic building blocks - trees, clusters, and tripartitions; (3) evolutionary network comparison: comparing two evolutionary networks in terms of topological dissimilarities, as well as fitness to sequence evolution under a maximum parsimony criterion; and (4) evolutionary network reconstruction: reconstructing an evolutionary network from a species tree and a set of gene trees.\\ The software package, PhyloNet, offers an array of utilities to allow for efficient and accurate analysis of evolutionary networks. The software package will help significantly in analyzing large data sets, as well as in studying the performance of evolutionary network reconstruction methods. Further, the software package supports the proposed eNewick format for compact representation of evolutionary networks, a feature that allows for efficient interoperability of evolutionary network software tools. Currently, all utilities in PhyloNet are invoked on the command line.},

    abstract = {<p>Multiple comparison or alignmentof protein sequences has become a fundamental tool in many different domains in modern molecular biology, from evolutionary studies to prediction of 2D/3D structure, molecular function and inter-molecular interactions etc. By placing the sequence in the framework of the overall family, multiple alignments can be used to identify conserved features and to highlight differences or specificities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive evaluation of many of the most popular methods for multiple sequence alignment (MSA), based on a new benchmark test set. The benchmark is designed to represent typical problems encountered when aligning the large protein sequence sets that result from today's high throughput biotechnologies. We show that alignmentmethods have significantly progressed and can now identify most of the shared sequence features that determine the broad molecular function(s) of a protein family, even for divergent sequences. However,we have identified a number of important challenges. First, the locally conserved regions, that reflect functional specificities or that modulate a protein's function in a given cellular context,are less well aligned. Second, motifs in natively disordered regions are often misaligned. Third, the badly predicted or fragmentary protein sequences, which make up a large proportion of today's databases, lead to a significant number of alignment errors. Based on this study, we demonstrate that the existing MSA methods can be exploited in combination to improve alignment accuracy, although novel approaches will still be needed to fully explore the most difficult regions. We then propose knowledge-enabled, dynamic solutions that will hopefully pave the way to enhanced alignment construction and exploitation in future evolutionary systems biology studies.</p>},

Then, based on the algorithm, we develop a prediction system and demonstrate the effectiveness of the system by presenting some experimental results obtained from biological data, where free energy evaluation selection for parse trees is incorporated into the algorithm.},

Drawing on evidence from a sample of morphologically complex terms in basic vocabulary for 149 globally distributed languages, it is ar- gued that cross-linguistically preferred synchronic relationships of word-forma- tion provide clues to likely directions of diachronic semantic developments. The hypothesis is tested against diachronic data from Indo-Aryan languages, and, in spite of a number of counterexamples, a correlation is found. In addition, it is shown how these data can be applied to semantic reconstruction, and a scenario of semantic change which involves morphological complexity in an early stage of semantic development is sketched.},

Identifying the primes in a new language is an opportunity to reinforce and/or revisit the theory. The remarks presented in this paper resulted from the identification process of the Finnish-based NSM primes. The goal of this paper is to direct attention to some fundamental aspects in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage theory, especially to the relation between the universal language-independent NSM concepts and the English-based NSM. A number of remarks are made on the general system of the primes, as the paper points out issues related to e.g. the number, selection and mutual hierarchy of the primes. The economy and logic of certain prime constructions and the argumentation behind allolexy are discussed as well.},

According to a widely accepted view, the truth-conditions of progressive sentences rely essentially on a notion of inertia. Dowty (Word meaning and Montague grammar: the semantics of verbs and times in generative grammar and in Montague's PTQ, D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, 1979) suggested inertia worlds to implement this "inertia idea" in a formal semantic theory of the progressive. The main thesis of the paper is that the notion of inertia went through a subtle, but crucial change when worlds were replaced by events in Landman (Nat Lang Semant 1:1-32, 1992) and Portner (Language 74(4):760-787, 1998), and that this new, event-related concept of inertia results in a possibility-based theory of the progressive. An important case in point in the paper is a proof that, despite its surface structure, the theory presented in Portner (1998) does not implement the notion of inertia in Dowty (1979); rather, it belongs together with Dowty's earlier, 1977 theory according to which the progressive is a possibility operator.},

    abstract = {Motivation: Protein database search is one of the fundamental problems in bioinformatics. For decades, it has been explored and solved using different exact and heuristic approaches. However, exponential growth of data in recent years has brought significant challenges in improving already existing algorithms. BLAST has been the most successful tool for protein database search, but is also becoming a bottleneck in many applications. Due to that, many different approaches have been developed to complement or replace it. In this article, we present SWORD, an efficient protein database search implementation that runs 8–16 times faster than BLAST in the sensitive mode and up to 68 times faster in the fast and less accurate mode. It is designed to be used in nearly all database search environments, but is especially suitable for large databases. Its sensitivity exceeds that of BLAST for majority of input datasets and provides guaranteed optimal alignments.Availability and Implementation: Sword is freely available for download from https://github.com/rvaser/swordContact: robert.vaser@fer.hr and mile.sikic@fer.hrSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

    abstract = {Cross-linguistic comparisons of compounds are difficult because of the varied criteria and terms used by different linguists (Scalise and Bisetto 2009). To address this problem, Scalise and Bisetto proposed a universal three-level classification of compound types. Although several researchers have shown that American Sign Language (ASL) has compound signs, a classification of compound types in ASL has not been completed. All of the potential compounds in an ASL dictionary (Costello 1994) were identified, then verified as compounds with the help of a fluent deaf signer by applying standard tests for composition. These compounds were then classified using the Scalise and Bisetto classification. We found that Scalise and Bisetto's three-level hierarchical classification successfully captured cross-category relationships among subtypes of compounds but fails to predict the existence of one type of compound attested in ASL. In our revised classification, a consistent set of criteria is used at each level, resulting in a classification that is both conceptually simpler and empirically more adequate. The second tier category for hierarchical compounds are bifurcated into the categories expressed predicate and unexpressed predicate, according to whether each predicate in a compound's semantic structure is expressed by one of the overt constituents. The revision has the further advantage of allowing us to avoid any reference to word class/grammatical category in applying our taxonomy, a goal that we show to be desirable on both theoretical and empirical grounds.},

After analyzing the criteria that allow us to distinguish between various instances of counterdirectional change, two principles underlying degrammaticalization are identified; one is related to the type of language and the other to the type of target structures in which degrammaticalization occurs. Firstly, the targets of degrammaticalization are usually closed-class parts of speech with an abstract semantic component. Secondly, the languages in which counter-directional grammatical changes occur turn out to be deprived of an elaborate fusional morphology. These findings may also have an impact on the theoretical conception of grammaticalization, some of whose definitional properties are discussed. The paper ends with a discussion of a more controversial point, namely, counter-directional changes by folk etymology rather than by etymology proper},

    volume = {10},
    pages = {99},
    year = {2009},
    abstract = {Genome scale data on protein interactions are generally represented as large networks, or graphs, where hundreds or thousands of proteins are linked to one another. Since proteins tend to function in groups, or complexes, an important goal has been to reliably identify protein complexes from these graphs. This task is commonly executed using clustering procedures, which aim at detecting densely connected regions within the interaction graphs. There exists a wealth of clustering algorithms, some of which have been applied to this problem. One of the most successful clustering procedures in this context has been the Markov Cluster algorithm (MCL), which was recently shown to outperform a number of other procedures, some of which were specifically designed for partitioning protein interactions graphs. A novel promising clustering procedure termed Affinity Propagation (AP) was recently shown to be particularly effective, and much faster than other methods for a variety of problems, but has not yet been applied to partition protein interaction graphs.\\ In this work we compare the performance of the Affinity Propagation (AP) and Markov Clustering (MCL) procedures. To this end we derive an unweighted network of protein-protein interactions from a set of 408 protein complexes from S. cervisiae hand curated in-house, and evaluate the performance of the two clustering algorithms in recalling the annotated complexes. In doing so the parameter space of each algorithm is sampled in order to select optimal values for these parameters, and the robustness of the algorithms is assessed by quantifying the level of complex recall as interactions are randomly added or removed to the network to simulate noise. To evaluate the performance on a weighted protein interaction graph, we also apply the two algorithms to the consolidated protein interaction network of S. cerevisiae, derived from genome scale purification experiments and to versions of this network in which varying proportions of the links have been randomly shuffled.\\ Our analysis shows that the MCL procedure is significantly more tolerant to noise and behaves more robustly than the AP algorithm. The advantage of MCL over AP is dramatic for unweighted protein interaction graphs, as AP displays severe convergence problems on the majority of the unweighted graph versions that we tested, whereas MCL continues to identify meaningful clusters, albeit fewer of them, as the level of noise in the graph increases. MCL thus remains the method of choice for identifying protein complexes from binary interaction networks.},

This has been a consistent generalization over the course of centuries, a surprising fact given that other aspects of poetic form in French were happily applied in English. This paper puts forward the hypothesis that this difference is not merely one of poetic tradition, but is grounded in the distinct ways in which information-structure affects prosody in the two languages. A study of rhyme usage in poetry and a perception experiment confirm that native speakers' intuitions about rhyming in the two languages indeed differ, and a further perception experiment supports the hypothesis that this fact is due to a constraint on prosody that is active in English but not in French. The findings suggest that certain forms of artistic expression in poetry are influenced, and even constrained, by more general properties of a language.},

This phenomenon of meaning change is often ignored in studies which use tools from statistical phylogenetic analysis to determine language relationships. It has been shown, that the databases currently used in linguistic phylogeny exhibit a considerable amount of the described phenomenon. The current study proposes a method to detect such instances of cross-concept relationships of words. Although the evaluation can not be done by standard means, the results indicate that semantic similarity is a good indicator for cross-concept relationships and that tools from computational biology offer a good framework for this kind of approach.},

To investigate the origin of Tibetans and the genetic basis of adaptation in a rigorous environment, we genotyped 30 Tibetan individuals with more than one million SNP markers. Our findings suggested that Tibetans, together with the Yi people, were descendants of Tibeto-Burmans who diverged from ancient settlers of East Asia. The valleys of the Hengduan Mountain range may be a major migration route. We also identified a set of positively-selected genes that belong to functional classes of the embryonic, female gonad, and blood vessel developments, as well as response to hypoxia. Most of these genes were highly correlated with population-specific and beneficial phenotypes, such as high infant survival rate and the absence of chronic mountain sickness.</p>},

One influential functional explanation claims that the imagined threat of supernatural punishment can suppress selfishness and enhance cooperation. Specifically, morally concerned supreme deities or \textquoteleftmoralizing high gods\textquoteright have been argued to reduce free-riding in large social groups, enabling believers to build the kind of complex societies that define modern humanity. Previous cross-cultural studies claiming to support the MHG hypothesis rely on correlational analyses only and do not correct for the statistical non-independence of sampled cultures. Here we use a Bayesian phylogenetic approach with a sample of 96 Austronesian cultures to test the MHG hypothesis as well as an alternative supernatural punishment hypothesis that allows punishment by a broad range of moralizing agents. We find evidence that broad supernatural punishment drives political complexity, whereas MHGs follow political complexity. We suggest that the concept of MHGs diffused as part of a suite of traits arising from cultural exchange between complex societies. Our results show the power of phylogenetic methods to address long-standing debates about the origins and functions of religion in human society.},

However, limitations in data and computational power have made assessing this hypothesis difficult. Here we present the first larger-scale study of the functional load hypothesis, using data from sound changes in a diverse set of languages. Our results support the functional load hypothesis: phoneme pairs undergoing merger distinguish significantly fewer minimal pairs in the lexicon than unmerged phoneme pairs. Furthermore, we show that higher phoneme probability is positively correlated with merger, but that this effect is stronger for phonemes that distinguish no minimal pairs. Finally, within our dataset we find that minimal pair count and phoneme probability better predict merger than change in system entropy at the lexical or phoneme level.},

    abstract = {Previous empirical studies of population size and language change have produced equivocal results. We therefore address the question with a new set of lexical data from nearly one-half of the world's languages. We first show that relative population sizes of modern languages can be extrapolated to ancestral languages, albeit with diminishing accuracy, up to several thousand years into the past. We then test for an effect of population against the null hypothesis that the ultrametric inequality is satisfied by lexical distances among triples of related languages. The test shows mainly negligible effects of population, the exception being an apparently faster rate of change in the larger of two closely related variants. A possible explanation for the exception may be the influence on emerging standard (or cross-regional) variants from speakers who shift from different dialects to the standard. Our results strongly indicate that the sizes of speaker populations do not in and of themselves determine rates of language change. Comparison of this empirical finding with previously published computer simulations suggests that the most plausible model for language change is one in which changes propagate on a local level in a type of network in which the individuals have different degrees of connectivity.},

    abstract = {Many aspects of morphological phylogenetics are controversial in the theoretical systematics literature and yet are often poorly explained and justified in empirical studies. In this paper, I argue that most morphological characters describe variation that is fundamentally quantitative, regardless of whether they are coded qualitatively or quantitatively by systematists. Given this view, three fundamental problems in morphological character analysis (definition, delimitation, and ordering of character states) may have a common solution: coding morphological characters as continuous quantitative traits. A new parsimony method (step-matrix gap-weighting, a modification of Thiele's approach) is proposed that allows quantitative traits to be analyzed as continuous variables. The problem of scaling or weighting quantitative characters relative to qualitative characters (and to each other) is reviewed, and three possible solutions are described. The new coding method is applied to data from hoplocercid lizards, and the results show the sensitivity of phylogenetic conclusions to different scaling methods. Although some authors reject the use of continuous, overlapping, quantitative characters in phylogenetic analysis, quantitative data from hoplocercid lizards that are coded using the new approach contain significant phylogenetic structure and exhibit levels of homoplasy similar to those seen in data that are coded qualitatively.},

    abstract = {German dialectology had its beginnings in the Romantic period, and it was at this time that the first attempts to transcribe dialect speech were made. The "Teuthonista"-system is shown to have been developed from that used by Heilig and Lenz in the Zeitschrift für hochdeutsche Mundarten ('Journal for Upper German Dialects' 1900—1905), which in itself represented a synthesis and further development of two earlier systems invented by Ferdinand Holthausen and by Friedrich Kaufmann, (both of whom had been influenced by Eduard Sievers). While a diacritic system, it did not go to the extremes of Oskar Brenner's system, which was overburdened with diacritics, and it was more suitable as an instrument for field work than Otto Bremer's 'monotype 4 system (ie. one sign for each sound), which, although exact, is a product of theory rather than practice and far too complicated for the phonetically untrained school-teachers who formed the main body of contributors to the journal. Lenz's reaction to Bremer's 'monotype' system caused him also to turn down the API system, which he himself had employed in his own studies of the Handschuhsheim dialect. Lenz's system has remained (with a few minor alterations) the accepted system of phonetic transcription of the German dialectological journals (Zeitschrift für hochdeutsche Mundarten — Zeitschrift für Deutsche Mundarten — Teuthonista — Zeitschrift für Mundartforschung). Today it no longer satisfies the demands made on it. It cannot reproduce centralized vowels, it does not differentiate between more than two degrees of opening, between half-long and over-long vowel quantity, between lenis and fortis in the case of voiced and unvoiced consonants. The fact that it is a diacritic system, however, makes it possible for it to be adjusted, renovated and augmented, and for it to become a fit and worthy instrument to serve the needs of modern scientific research. This is necessary, in order that the vast body of previous dialect studies (with which we cannot dispense in view of the rapid decline of the old rural dialects) might be incorporated into modern research. A break in tradition would make this older material less accessible.},

    abstract = {Curious parallels between the processes of species and language evolution have been observed by many researchers. Retracing the evolution of Indo-European (IE) languages remains one of the most intriguing intellectual challenges in historical linguistics. Most of the IE language studies use the traditional phylogenetic tree model to represent the evolution of natural languages, thus not taking into account reticulate evolutionary events, such as language hybridization and word borrowing which can be associated with species hybridization and horizontal gene transfer, respectively. More recently, implicit evolutionary networks, such as split graphs and minimal lateral networks, have been used to account for reticulate evolution in linguistics.},

    abstract = {A sensitive protein-fold recognition procedure was developed on the basis of iterative database search using the PSI-BLAST program. A collection of 1193 position-dependent weight matrices that can be used as fold identifiers was produced. In the completely sequenced genomes, folds could be automatically identified for 20%-30% of the proteins, with 3%-6% more detectable by additional analysis of conserved motifs. The distribution of the most common folds is very similar in bacteria and archaea but distinct in eukaryotes. Within the bacteria, this distribution differs between parasitic and free-living species. In all analyzed genomes, the P-loop NTPases are the most abundant fold. In bacteria and archaea, the next most common folds are ferredoxin-like domains, TIM-barrels, and methyltransferases, whereas in eukaryotes, the second to fourth places belong to protein kinases, beta-propellers and TIM-barrels. The observed diversity of protein folds in different proteomes is approximately twice as high as it would be expected from a simple stochastic model describing a proteome as a finite sample from an infinite pool of proteins with an exponential distribution of the fold fractions. Distribution of the number of domains with different folds in one protein fits the geometric model, which is compatible with the evolution of multidomain proteins by random combination of domains. [Fold predictions for proteins from 14 proteomes are available on the World Wide Web at. The FIDs are available by anonymous ftp at the same location.]},

However, it has been known for decades that there are regions of solution space in which parsimony is a poor estimator of tree topology. Numerous software implementations of likelihood-based models for the estimation of phylogeny from discrete morphological data exist, especially for the Mk model of discrete character evolution. Here we explore the efficacy of Bayesian estimation of phylogeny, using the Mk model, under conditions that are commonly encountered in paleontological studies. Using simulated data, we describe the relative performances of parsimony and the Mk model under a range of realistic conditions that include common scenarios of missing data and rate heterogeneity.</p>},

This assumption is sometimes unrealistic, as has been revealed by analysis of real sequence data. In the present paper Felsenstein's method is extended to the case where substitution rates over sites are described by the gamma distribution. A numerical example is presented to show that the method fits the data better than do previous models.},

This result raises questions about previous studies in which AoA was not controlled and about current theories in which it is not addressed. Analyses of the materials used in previous studies suggest that the observed AoA effects may have been due to other factors. We also found little evidence for an AoA effect in computational models of reading that used words that exhibit normal spelling-sound regularities. An AoA effect was observed, however, in a model in which early and late learned words did not overlap in terms of orthography or phonology. The results suggest that with other correlated properties of stimuli controled, AoA effects occur when what is learned about early patterns does not carry over to later ones. This condition is not characteristic of learning spelling-sound mappings but may be relevant to tasks such as learning the names for objects.},

    abstract = {Adaptive evolution at the molecular level can be studied by detecting convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level. For a set of homologous protein sequences, the ancestral amino acids at all interior nodes of the phylogenetic tree of the proteins can be statistically inferred. The amino acid sites that have experienced convergent or parallel changes on independent evolutionary lineages can then be identified by comparing the amino acids at the beginning and end of each lineage. At present, the efficiency of the methods of ancestral sequence inference in identifying convergent and parallel changes is unknown. More seriously, when we identify convergent or parallel changes, it is unclear whether these changes are attributable to random chance. For these reasons, claims of convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level have been disputed. We have conducted computer simulations to assess the efficiencies, of the parsimony and Bayesian methods of ancestral sequence inference in identifying convergent and parallel-change sites. Our results showed that the Bayesian method performs better than the parsimony method in identifying parallel changes, and both methods are inefficient in identifying convergent changes. However, the Bayesian method is recommended for estimating the number of convergent-change sites because it gives a conservative estimate. We have developed statistical tests for examining whether the observed numbers of convergent and parallel changes are due to random chance. As an example, we reanalyzed the stomach lysozyme sequences of foregut fermenters and found that parallel evolution is statistically significant, whereas convergent evolution is not well supported.},

There are two important yet not well-studied parameters in this approach: the conventional size of vocabulary list to collect potentially true cognates and the minimum matching instances required to confirm a recurrent sound correspondence. Here, we derive two statistical principles from stochastic theorems to quantify these parameters. These principles validate the practice of using the Swadesh 100- and 200-word lists to indicate degree of relatedness between languages, and enable a frequency-based, dynamic threshold to detect recurrent sound correspondences. Using statistical tests, we further evaluate the generality of the Swadesh 100-word list compared to the Swadesh 200-word list and other 100-word lists sampled randomly from the Swadesh 200-word list. All these provide mathematical support for applying lexicostatistics in historical and comparative linguistics.},

    abstract = {Researchers have long been interested in the evolution of culture and the ways in which change in cultural systems can be reconstructed and tracked. Within the realm of language, these questions are increasingly investigated with Bayesian phylogenetic methods. However, such work in cultural phylogenetics could be improved by more explicit quantification of reconstruction and transition probabilities. We apply such methods to numerals in the languages of Australia. As a large phylogeny with almost universal \textquoteleftlow-limit\textquoteright systems, Australian languages are ideal for investigating numeral change over time. We reconstruct the most likely extent of the system at the root and use that information to explore the ways numerals evolve. We show that these systems do not increment serially, but most commonly vary their upper limits between 3 and 5. While there is evidence for rapid system elaboration beyond the lower limits, languages lose numerals as well as gain them. We investigate the ways larger numerals build on smaller bases, and show that there is a general tendency to both gain and replace 4 by combining 2 + 2 (rather than inventing a new unanalysable word \textquoteleftfour\textquoteright). We develop a series of methods for quantifying and visualizing the results.},

    abstract = {Morphological decomposition is an important part of complex word processing. In Chinese, this requires a comprehensive consideration of phonological, orthographic and morphemic information. The left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG) has been implicated in this process in alphabetic languages. However, it is unclear whether the neural mechanisms underlying morphological processing in alphabetic languages would be the same in Chinese, a logographic language. To investigate the neural basis of morphological processing in Chinese compound words, an fMRI experiment was conducted using an explicit auditory morphological judgment task. Results showed the L-IFG to be a core area in Chinese morphological processing, consistent with research in alphabetic languages. Additionally, a broad network consisting of the L-MTG, the bilateral STG and the L-FG that taps phonological, orthographic, and semantic information was found to be involved. These results provide evidence that the L-IFG plays an important role in morphological processing even in languages that are typologically different.},

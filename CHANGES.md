- Languoid INI files may now contain a section [links], providing links

  for AES status - stored in INI files.
- Glottolog data releases are now supplemented by a CLDF dataset
  (see https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog-cldf)
  for better accessibility - in particular of the languoid data, which is 
  organized as CLDF parameters, e.g. coding AES and MED for languages.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The Mimi language as documented by Gaston Decorse in
	**hh:hw:Gaudefroy-Demombynes:Oubangui-Chari** is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26. I have never been able to find out where Decorse collected the wordlist and where his informant came from but presumably it was collected somewhere in SE Chad or NE Central African Republic on Decorse's trip in 1902-1904 (**hh:h:Decorse:Congo-Tchad**) and the wordlist shows Arabic and Maban loans (**hh:hv:Starostin:Mimi**), so it was probably also spoken in Wadai. The language has not been sighted for over a century and is therefore likely extinct.

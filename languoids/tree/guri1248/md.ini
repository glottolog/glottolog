[classification]
family = Laycock never presented real evidence for a Kwomtari-Baibai-Pyu family
	**hh:hv:Laycock:SkoKwomtariLeftMay**. It is clear from the data collected so far
	**hh:hvs:Baron:Kwomtari** that Guriaso [grx] shares no more lexical cognates
	with Kwomtari and Biaka than expected at random, and that's not even when
	borrowing is discounted (Kwomtari neighbours Guriaso). Further correspondences
	presented are merely typological or random enough to make Japanese a Kwomtari
	language **hh:hvs:Baron:Kwomtari**:29.

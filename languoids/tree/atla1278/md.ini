[classification]
family = The core is held together by regular sound correspondences in lexical items between subfamily languages, less systematic verbal extensions and noun class systems **hh:hv:Stewart:Potou-Akanic-Bantu**, **hh:hv:Stewart:Three-Grade**, **hh:hv:PozdniakovSegerer:Atlantiques**, **hh:hv:Hyman:Niger-Congo** **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:154-174, 177-179, 180-189, 194-199, 200-213, 213-223, 223-231, 232-234, 353-358. Mande **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:189-192, 353-358, Kordofanian **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:223-231, 232-234, 353-358, Ijoid **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:174-177, 232-234, 353-358, Kru with/without Siamou **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:177-179, 232-234, 353-358 and Dogon (cf. **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:192-193, 232-234, 353-358) have not yet been shown to stand up to these criteria wherefore they are excluded. The Pre or Mbre language in CÃ´te d'Ivoire, known from wordlists only, is Atlantic-Congo but cannot be assigned to a specific branch at this time **hh:w:Blench:Pre**, **hh:vld:Boukari:Pre** **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:180. The Mpra (= Mpre) language in Ghana has cognates with Atlantic-Congo especially Guang **hh:hew:Goody:Guang**, including numerals 2-5, but the bulk of the little vocabulary that is known, is not Atlantic-Congo **hh:w:Blench:Mpra**. On the grounds that the numerals are less likely to be borrowed, and that lexical innovation may produce vocabulary that looks unrelated to anything else, we count Mpra as an Atlantic-Congo language. Aproumu Aizi [ahp]: **hh:dial:MarcheseHook:Aizi** **hh:ld:Ahate:Apro** does not seem to be a Kru language but, judging from the numerals, appears to be an Atlantic-Congo language (I wish to thank Roger Blench for highlighting the divergent nature of this language).

comment = Kpessi (5078-kef) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Kpési is learned as an L1 by all Kpési people living in the traditional language area... Kpési is the preferred language of the Kpési people and there are no indications of occurring or impending language shift. Attitudes towards Kpési also seemed positive: young people expressed pride in their language, and elders discouraged the use of other languages (apart from French). Young people had a better command of Ewe than the older people, but this did not seem to influence their use of Kpési as the language of choice. Likewise, the popularity of the Ewe literacy program in the village Kpési does not indicate a possible shift... interviewees expressed interest in Kpési language development and in becoming literate in it. However, no informant was aware of any written materials currently available in Kpési.) [Durieux et al. 2011](elcat:7d57783f3e3622fcbda6e50a9128094c)

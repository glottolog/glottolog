comment = Dompo (3745-doy) = Severely Endangered (20 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Dompo is spoken by ten households, all of whom are also fluent in Nafaanra.  All members of these households seem to have some command of the
	language, but whether it will be transmitted to the next generation in more than an attenuated form is open  to doubt. Nonetheless, there is no evidence that it has ever been spoken by many people and bilingualism in Nafaanra must long have been a feature of the community. There are presently some 60-70 people with some command of the language and  perhaps 10 who can recall obscure lexical items.) [Blench 1999](cldf:blench:99:4)

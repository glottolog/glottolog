comment = Effutu (1456) = Threatened (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (95% of Winneba residents who responded to this survey spoke Effutu. 59.5% reported that Effutu was the primary language used in their home; however, the language used most often overall was Fante for 73.2% of respondents. Language use across generations varies; 88.9% of Winneba residents aged 51 or more learned Effutu as their first language, but only 58.3% of those 31-50, and 52.7% of those under 30. The pattern clearly indicates language loss through the generations. Clearly, Effutu is losing grounds to Fante. Winneba children are not using the Effutu language because some parents prefer speaking to their children in Fante rather than the indigenous language.)

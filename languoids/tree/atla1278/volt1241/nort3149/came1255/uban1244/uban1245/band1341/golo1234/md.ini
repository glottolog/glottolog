[classification]
sub = No author on the Bandaic languages (**hh:hvw:Olson:Banda**, **hh:hv:Boyd:Adamawa-Ubangi**, **hh:hv:Cloarec-Heiss:Banda** if they even mention it) seems to have made an explicit comparison between Golo and the remaining Bandaic languages. Looking at the data my impression is that it diverges from all other Banda lects (which are similar among themselves). Although this could be due to rapid changes occurring in Golo (which was under heavy pressure from at least Ndogo) the natural interpretation is that it is coordinate with the rest of Banda. This seems to have been the impression of **hh:h:TuckerBryan:Non-Bantu-NEAfrica:1956**:31-36 as well and not contradicted by e.g. **hh:g:Cloarec-Heiss:Banda-Linda**:18-19

comment = Field investigations up to approximately 1950
	consistently report a language called Golo
	(**hh:hew:Marno:Aequatorial**, **hh:hw:Schweinfurth:Central-Afrika**, **hh:he:Cummins:Bahr-El-Ghazal-Dinkas**, **hh:h:Tucker:Eastern-Sudanic**, **hh:h:Tucker:Wau**, **hh:s:Santandrea:Banda-Zande**, **hh:s:Santandrea:Golo**)
	west of Wau. The people are reported to be ethnographically closely allied to the Ndogo but the language is clearly Bandaic. Yet it differs from all other Bandaic languages more than they differ among each other and therefore represents a language of its own
	(**hh:h:TuckerBryan:Non-Bantu-NEAfrica:1956**:31-36). The language is conspicuously missing from more recent listings of Bandaic languages and languages of South Sudan, for no apparent reason. Although one may suspect the language is endangered --- with shift towards Ndogo --- **hh:h:TuckerBryan:Non-Bantu-NEAfrica:1956**:36 give reasons for a more optimistic view.

comment = Notre (3808-bly) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Even though there are no indications of imminent language shift toward any of the local L2s, it is noted that reportedly many children use both Boulba and Biali inside and outside the home. Thus, for the future, language shift toward Biali cannot be excluded.  According to interviewed chiefs and elders in Bourniéssou, Nanèbou, and Sépounga, Boulba is the predominant language for community activities and is used extensively in most public domains, such as announcements, community meetings, and all customary rites.)

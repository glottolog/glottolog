comment = Wawa (6105-www) = Threatened (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (At present, the Wawa are maintaining their language to a large degree. The language is still being transmitted to children, and is spoken on a daily basis and in all contexts except the religious (the Wawa are all Muslim and thus use Arabic in the religious domain). Wawa is an unwritten language and all children are taught to read the Koran. Moreover, cultural changes largely involving assimilation to a Muslim Fulbe way of life mean that Fulfulde can be seen as a potential linguistic threat.)

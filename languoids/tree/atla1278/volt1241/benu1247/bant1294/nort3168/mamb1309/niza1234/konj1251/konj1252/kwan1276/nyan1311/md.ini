comment = Nyanjang (534) = Critically Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Njanga speakers have remained relatively isolated from the direct influence of the Fulbe. Their village is comparatively underdeveloped and less modernized. Indirectly, however, population movements stimulated by the Fulbe arrival in the region brought Njanga speakers into closer contact with speakers of the neighboring dialect Sundani, which has now fully replaced the Njanga... There are now only four remaining speakers of Njanga plus six rememberers, and it has no function, everyday or ceremonial, that is not met by the replacement language. For this reason, Njanga is moribund. Unlike Wawa, the threat to Njanga is not Fulfulde– although almost all people of Mbondjanga speak Fulfulde–but Sundani, a sister dialect and the replacement language.)

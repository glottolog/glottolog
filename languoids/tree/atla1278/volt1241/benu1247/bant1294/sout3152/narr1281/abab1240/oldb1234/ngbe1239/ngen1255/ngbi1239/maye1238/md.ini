[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23 has a separate entry for Mayeka [myc],
	a Bantu language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is very likely to be the same as Ngbinda [nbd] since **hh:he:deCalonne:Ubangi-Uele-Aruwimi**:114, 120, 247, 251 calls Mayeka a clan of Abangbinda, though no actual linguistic data is presented. The information on Mayeka [myc] in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23 presumably derives from
	**hh:hv:HackettvanBulck:ETeam** who took down a Mayeka wordlist but were not able to find out the location of Mayeka, and did not have access to a Ngbinda wordlist (**hh:hsoc:vanBulck:Mission**:74-75) to check if Mayeka and Ngbinda were the same. Though, at the present time, if Hackett and van Bulck's unpublished Mayeka wordlist still exists in an archive somewhere, it should be checked whether the data is actually Ngbinda or a different, but related, language.

comment = Ikizu and Sizaki share 95% lexical similarity and the same phonological
	innovations. Perceived intelligibility is very high. Ikizu and Sizaki speakers
	consider themselves separate ethnic groups with the same ancestral history
	speaking basically the same language. During group interviews, Sizaki speakers
	said that only when older people speak can one hear some differences.

comment = According to **hh:w:vanderBurgt:Watwa**, the language of the Kitwa among the
	Rundi speak a language of their own (in addition to Kirundi itself) which is not
	understood by the neighbouring Watussi and the Wahutu speakers and has the same
	grammar as Kirundi but is lexically different (the bulk of which is nevertheless
	of Rundi origin!). This language is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19.

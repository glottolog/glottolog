[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = According to the in-depth observer van der Burgt, the language of the Kitwa among the Rundi speak a language of their own (in addition to Kirundi itself) which is not understood by the neighbouring Rundi
	(Watussi and Wahutu) speakers (**hh:w:vanderBurgt:Watwa**:79,
	**hh:e:vanderBurgt:Warundi**:73-74), and has the same grammar as Kirundi but is lexically different (the bulk of which is nevertheless of Rundi origin!). This language is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28. (Later researchers (see **hh:e:Seitz:Twa**:39-42), in particular
	**hh:lde:Schumacher:Kivu**:253-256, have found accented varieties of Kirundi spoken by the Batwa, but not so different as to be unintelligible. The variety described by
	**hh:w:vanderBurgt:Watwa**:79 must therefore either have been assimilated in the meantime or have been too subtle to discern.)

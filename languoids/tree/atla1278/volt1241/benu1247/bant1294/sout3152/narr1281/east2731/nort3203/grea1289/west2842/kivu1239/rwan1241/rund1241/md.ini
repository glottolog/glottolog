[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = According to **hh:w:vanderBurgt:Watwa**, the language of the Kitwa among the Rundi speak a language of their own (in addition to Kirundi itself) which is not understood by the neighbouring Watussi and the Wahutu speakers and has the same grammar as Kirundi but is lexically different (the bulk of which is nevertheless of Rundi origin!). This language is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26.

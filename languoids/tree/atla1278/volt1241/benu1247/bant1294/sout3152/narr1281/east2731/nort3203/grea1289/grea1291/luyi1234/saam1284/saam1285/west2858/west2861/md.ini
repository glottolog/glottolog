[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The Nyala [nle] entry lists two dialects West Nyala and East Nyala.
	But the West Nyala language spoken on the shores of Lake Victoria in Busia district in Kenya is a different language from the non-adjacent East Nyala spoken inland (**hh:hvtyp:Kanyoro:Abaluyia**). The two are not mutually intelligible
	(**hh:s:Ochwaya:Lunyala**:7-8) despite both having the name Nyala and being the the Abaluyia group. One of the two is thus missing from E16/E17/E18/E19. See also: East Nyala [nle].

comment = Vidunda (1101-vid) = Threatened (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (With regard to language acquisition in early childhood all Vidunda interviewees stated that their mother tongue (MT) was Vidunda. This implies that the current parent generation mainly speaks to their children in L1 [Vidunda] and that the latter enjoy a far-reaching exposure to L1 in the homestead. [...] Standard 1 children had no linguistic alternative, as they were almost all only L1 speaking. By standard 7 the situation has drastically changed: 93 percent declared that they communicate in L2 [Swahili] with peers, and only a small group claimed that they speak L1 to each other. [...] In a rather bilingual environment, the future parent generation (the current primary school learners) displays L2 competence and proficiency as well as L2 use that, by and large, exceed that of L1. [...] Coupled with strong formal and moral L2 support, the chances of L1 to be transmitted in the future to another young generation diminish drastically.)

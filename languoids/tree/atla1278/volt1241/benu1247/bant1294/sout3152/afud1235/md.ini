[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Afudu is a language only known from a wordlist in **hh:hw:Koelle:Polyglotta**. **hh:hw:Koelle:Polyglotta**:20 related the demise of the people and since the language has not been heard of again it is presumably extinct. Its exact location **hh:hw:Koelle:Polyglotta**:20 was identified as southeast of Takum in Nigeria by **hh:h:Meek:Semi-Bantu**:223 but remains somewhat uncertain. Its classification has seldom been addressed but was placed in Bantoid by (**hh:h:Williamson:Benue-Congo**:277) in a subgroup that would fall in Southern Bantoid in subsequent work. The languages is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28.

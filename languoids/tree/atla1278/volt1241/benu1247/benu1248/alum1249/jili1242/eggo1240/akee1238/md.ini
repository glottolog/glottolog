comment = Ake (3698-aik) = Vulnerable (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (In general, Ake still seems to be spoken generally among  the people of the four villages. Elders in Ugah  complain that more and more of the children there are speaking Hausa, which is to be expected in such a  multilingual community. Nonetheless, it seemed that Ake was still widely understood by young people, so the  language is probably not unduly threatened. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that there are more than 2000 speakers,
	so complacency is not in order.) [Blench 2006](elcat:1c303b0eed3133200cf715285011b4e4)

comment = Sur (488-tdl) = Vulnerable (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Even young children are learning the language and there is no evidence of a decline in competence. Even more surprisingly, but no doubt related, the language is by no means full of loanwords from Hausa and Ngas, as is sometimes the case.) [Blench 1998](elcat:89885ff2c83a10305ee08bd507c1049c)

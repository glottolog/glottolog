comment = Horom (487-hoe) = Vulnerable (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Surprisingly, the language does not seem unduly threatened; during the language elicitation session it seemed that many of the children present were able to produce the required lexical items simultaneously with the adults. This situation may be explained partly by the remoteness of Horom, although remoteness has not prevented the Chadic languages in the Bauchi area from disappearing. [...] Horom culture is still very much alive and presumably this has acted to preserve the language as well.) [Blench 1998](elcat:89885ff2c83a10305ee08bd507c1049c)

comment = Ayu (489-ayu) = Severely Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Many of the ethnic Ayu living [near Fadan Ayu] have only a limited command of the language. The dominant language is this area is Hausa and almost the entire population seems fluent in it... Children appear to have a passive knowledge of Ayu but do not speak it on a daily basis. Even the older generation are easily at a loss for words in Ayu and it seems that it is not spoken all that much on a daily basis. Despite this, the Ayu are intensely proud of their culture and history and it clear that Ayu identity is not under threat. Consequently the loss of the language could probably be reversed.)

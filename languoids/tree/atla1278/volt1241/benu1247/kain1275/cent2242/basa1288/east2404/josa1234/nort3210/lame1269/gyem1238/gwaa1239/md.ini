[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28 lists Gwa [gwb] as a separate Jarawan Bantu language of Nigeria. The information on Gwa emanates from a 1971 survey
	(**hh:hvw:MaddiesonWilliamson:Jarawan**:126, 136) which recorded that the ``Lame District Head claims that there is a distinct language called Gwa ... In an area centred four miles west of Lame village''.  Although not exactly four miles west of Lame, there is a Gwa village southwest of Lame
	(**hh:h:Danladi:Gyem-Izora-Shau**:1-2, **hh:w:Shimizu:82**:98,
	122-123) which is the only reasonable correlate for a separate language. (Exactly four miles west of Lame is where the Lame [bma], a Jarawan Bantu language with the lects Gura, Ruhu and Mbaru) is/was spoken (**hh:hvw:MaddiesonWilliamson:Jarawan**:124).)
	The inhabitants of Gwa have shifted to Hausa
	(**hh:w:Shimizu:82**:122-123) but they claim that their ancestral language survives in a village called Gem. In Gem people claim that their grandparents shifted to the language of Gwa, i.e., the original Gwa before the shift to Hausa (p.c. Mark van de Velde
	2025). The little lexical data obtained from Gem suggest that it is
	(nearly) identical to Gyem [gye] / Shau [sqh], i.e. Eastern Kainji languages, which already have entries (p.c. Mark van de Velde
	2025). In sum, there is no convincing evidence for a Gwa [gwb] language in this area that is separate from both Lame [bma], Gyem [gye] and Shau [sqh]. I further wish to thank Roger Blench for discussing the entry with me. See also: Gyem [gye], Lame [bma], Shau [sqh].

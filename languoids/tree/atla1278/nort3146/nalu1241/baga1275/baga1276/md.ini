[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The Baga Binari [bcg] entry presumably refers to the indigenous language of the island of Binari. (The entry contains inconsistent information in that ``Kalum'' is given as an alternative name and the language is said to be similar to, and subclassified with Temne and Baga language. The indigenous language of Binari is not closely related to or saliently similar to the Temne and Baga languages.)
	The indigenous language of Binari is the same as that in the Baga Mboteni [bgm] entry (**hh:h:Voeltz:Guinee**:25-26) and is thus spurious. See also: Baga Mboteni-Binari [bcg].

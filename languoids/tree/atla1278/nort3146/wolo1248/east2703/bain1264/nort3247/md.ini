comment = The now probably extinct (**hh:styp:Cobbinah:Bainounk-Gubeeher**:32)
	Northeast Bainounk varieties of northeast Casamance (once spoken in the villages Kamanka, Kansambu, Diouroul, Velingara and Samakoung) are missing in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 either as part of other entries or as an entry of their own. Since they were only about 60% lexicostatistically cognate
	(**hh:sv:Doneux:Buy**:87) to the other variety of Bainounk, they must be inferred not to have been intelligible to other Bainounk speakers. I wish to thank Guillaume Segerer for bringing this case my to attention.

comment = The now probably extinct (**hh:styp:Cobbinah:Bainounk-Gubeeher**:32)
	Northeast Bainounk varieties of northeast Casamance (once spoken in the villages
	Kamanka, Kansambu, Diouroul, Velingara and Samakoung) are missing in
	E16/E17/E18/E19 either as part of other entries or as an entry of their own.
	Since they were only about 60% lexicostatistically cognate
	(**hh:sv:Doneux:Buy**:87) to the other variety of Bainounk, they must be
	inferred not to have been intelligible to other Bainounk speakers. I wish to
	thank Guillaume Segerer for bringing this case my to attention.

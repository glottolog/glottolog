comment = Lebu Wolof is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a dialect of (Senegalese-Mauretanian)
	Wolof
	[wol]. However, Lebu Wolof is not intelligible to other Wolof speakers, e.g.,
	Wolof speakers cannot readiy understand the text specimina of Lebu in
	**hh:w:Angrand:Lebous**, as opposed to Gambian Wolof [wof] which is intelligible
	to (Senegalese-Mauretanian) Wolof
	[wol] but uses a different written standard and source of loanwords.
	The distinctness of Lebu Wolof is hidden by the fact that all Lebu Wolof
	speakers are also bilingual in non-Lebu Wolof. See also: Wolof [wol], Gambian
	Wolof [wof].

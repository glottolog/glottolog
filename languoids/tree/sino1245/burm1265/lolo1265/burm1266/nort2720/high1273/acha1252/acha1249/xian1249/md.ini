comment = E16/E17 has a separate entry for Xiandao [xia]
	noting that ``Some consider it a dialect of Achang [acn]''. In fact,
	it is easily mutually intelligible with Achang [acn]
	(**hh:g:Dai:Xiandao**, **hh:soc:TsungDai:Xiandao**) and so has little basis for
	forming a separate entry. See also: Longchuan Achang [acn].

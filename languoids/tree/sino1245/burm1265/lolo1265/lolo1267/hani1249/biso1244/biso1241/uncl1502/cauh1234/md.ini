[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = A survey of Phunoi-related varieties in Phongsali Province in Laos reveals that Ca Ho is a language not inherently intelligibile to Phunoi [pho] nor to any other language in E16/E17/E18/E19 and is thus missing from E16/E17/E18/E19 (**hh:hv:Wright:Phongsali**). See also: Phunoi [pho].

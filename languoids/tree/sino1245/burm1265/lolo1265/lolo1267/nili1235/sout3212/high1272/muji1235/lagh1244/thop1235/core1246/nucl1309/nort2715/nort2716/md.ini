comment = Northern Muji (3175-ymx) = Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Some villages in Xiepo have begun to shift to (southwestern) Mandarin 50 years ago. Conversation in the home domains are 50% in Northern Muji and 50% in Mandarin. For the Northern Muji living close to cities, only middle aged and elderly people are able to speak Northern Muji. As for the ethnic Nothern Muji who live in Luoshuidong, none of them speak Northern Muji. Community announcements and meetings are all in Mandarin.)

comment = Samei (5392-smh) = Threatened (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Extinct in some northwestern villages very close to Kunming city, severely endangered to the east in northeastern Guandu and Yiliang, and endangered in Ala Township which is the centre of the Samei distribution and where most villages are entirely or largely Samei. Few fully fluent young speakers, though many children have passive understanding of the language.) [Bradley 2007](elcat:c1b8bf9e071c0dabb899e7a27f353762)

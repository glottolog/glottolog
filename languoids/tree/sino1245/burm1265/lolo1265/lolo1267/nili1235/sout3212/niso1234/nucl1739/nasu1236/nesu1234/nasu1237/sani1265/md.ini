comment = Sanie (7254-ysy) = Severely Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ("Sanie presents a typical example of language shift in progress. Firstly, there are doubtless many residents of the Kunming area with unremembered Sanie ancestry. In the villages closest to the city, Chejiabi, Shiju and Zhaozong at the foot of Xishan, the language is dying; only those over sixty speak well, with some younger people able to understand a bit; but children do not know the language at all, even though their grandparents, who are bilingual, often care for them. These villages have long been in contact with the Han; the main road from Kunming to Dali used to pass right through the centre of Chejiabi. They are now completely surrounded and outnumbered by Han Chinese and well-integrated into the urban economy. However, at least in Chejiabi, the village leaders have recently started to identify more strongly as Yi, and have erected a village gate with characters in Reformed Yunnan Yi writing and a park with paintings of traditional Yi stories and inscriptions in these characters.
	
	In the first villages in the mountains, such as Daxing and Huahongyuan, the youngest semi-speakers are young adults, but again children are not learning the language. These villages have been in close contact with the Han for many years. In the next ring of villages out, such as Baimei, Yuhua and those in northeast Gulu, closer contact with Han Chinese started after 1950 and Sanie is still used to a limited extent by children, but most are semispeakers. The most distant villages, such as those in eastern Tuanjia, central Gulu, Anning and Fumin, are still relatively remote but have also started to have extensive contact with Han Chinese and not many young people speak Sanie fluently there."

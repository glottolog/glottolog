[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = North-Central Tangkhul Naga, attested from the village of Champhung (**hh:hvw:Brown:Indo-Chinese**) is typically subsumed under the lingua franca Tangkhul Naga. However, it is so different from (East-Central) Tangkhul Naga [nmf] or any other language in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28 that it is very unlikely to be inherently intelligible to any of them (**hh:hv:MortensenMiller:Tangkhulic**, **hh:hv:Mortensen:Tangkhul**). See also: East-Central Tangkhul Naga [nmf].

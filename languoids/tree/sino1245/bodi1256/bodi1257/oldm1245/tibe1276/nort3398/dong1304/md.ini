[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Dongna, a Tibetic language of China, is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28 (**hh:g:Shao:Hexi-Zang**). It has variously been considered a Khams dialect or an Amdo dialect but is not intelligible to at least some Amdo and Khams dialects (**hh:g:Shao:Hexi-Zang**:365-371) and thus merits its own entry. I wish to thank Andrew Hsiu for bringing this language to my attention.

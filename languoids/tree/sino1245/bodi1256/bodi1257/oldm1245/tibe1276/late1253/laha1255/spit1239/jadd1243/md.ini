comment = Jad (4321-jda) = Endangered (40 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ([Tibeto-Burman language] speakers in this area are in close contact with the dominant speakers of Garhwali and Kumauni in their oral communication and with Hindi in written and spoken modes due to the nature of the socio-political and educational systems. The TB speakers start learning both their native languages and Kumauni or Garhwali simultaneously. Native languages are learnt at home within the family and Garhwali or Kumauni is learnt from friends outside the home... There is an increasing amount of code switching between Hindi and Kumauni/Garhwali in discussions, both formal and informal. Hindi enjoys high prestige and the TB languages have low prestige... If the present socio-political and economic situation, and the sociolinguistic patterns of language use continue to exist, it is possible to predict that the speakers of the TB languages in this region will eventually shift completely to the majority languages, though it may turn out that a stable bilingualism will continue to exist, preserving the TB languages.)

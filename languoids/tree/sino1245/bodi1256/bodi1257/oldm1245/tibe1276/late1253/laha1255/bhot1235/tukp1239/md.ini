[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Tukpa [tpq] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28 as a separate language from Kinnauri [kfk] and Bhoti Kinnauri [nes].  The name Tukpa locally refers to an administrative unit comprising villages such as Kamru and Batseri in the Sangla valley along the river (**hh:s:Saxena:Sangla-Kinnauri-Sketch**:24). This area is the heartland of the language of the Kinnauri [kfk] entry as old
	(**hh:hld:Beames:Indian**:56) and modern data
	(**hh:s:Saxena:Sangla-Kinnauri-Sketch**:24-25) clearly confirm.  The entry Tukpa [tpq] states that its location is ``Himachal Pradesh state: Kinnaur district, Charang, Kunnu, and Nesang villages'' which is northeast of the area locally referred to as Tukpa. We can compare this location with that given for Bhoti Kinnauri [nes]:
	``Kinnaur district, Morang sub-district, Nesang village in upper Kinnauri Sutlej river basin; Puh sub-district, Puh village; possibly Charang and Kuno villages.''. A possible interpretation is that Tukpa (although misleadingly named) could denote the language of Charang and Kuno/Kunnu, as opposed to both Kinnauri [kfk] and Bhoti Kinnauri [nes]. However, data from Kuno show that this variety is very close to those of Poo and Nako, and does not justify treating Kuno as an opposed separate language
	(**hh:hv:Saxena:Empirical-Kinnauri**:22). Thus a Tukpa [tpq]
	language separate from Kinnauri [kfk] and Bhoti Kinnauri [nes] is not warranted. I wish to thank Harvinder Negi for bringing this case to our attention. See also: Khunu-TÃ¶t [nes], Kinnauri [kfk].

comment = Eastern Gurung (4207-ggn) = Threatened (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ("Overall, Gurung speakers have a positive attitude towards their language and have desires for development in their language. However, language vitality is declining. Gurung language use in the home, religious, village, and marketplace domains indicates younger and more educated speakers are using Gurung less than older and uneducated speakers. Nepali proficiency is reportedly high among all generations. The degree of intergenerational transfer of Gurung is low, especially by younger parents. The Gurung language is decreasingly being passed on to children and Nepali usage among even very young children is increasing. Gurung children are learning Nepali before they enter school and formal education is conducted in Nepali. These factors combined point to diminishing language vitality among the Gurung communities, especially among the younger generation."

comment = Thangmi (4838-thf) = Threatened (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ("[C]hildren and youths up to the age of twenty speak Nepali as their first language.... While as a heritage ethnic tongue, Thangmi is still widely understood, many in this age group speak the Thangmi language with a reduced phonology and with a heavy reliance on Nepali loan words." (p. 103)) ['bib7463']

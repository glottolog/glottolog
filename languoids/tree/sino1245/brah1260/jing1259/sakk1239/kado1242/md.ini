comment = Research conducted in 2008 showed that Kadu and Kanan speakers do not adequately
	understand each other's languages, and have to switch to Burmese in order to
	communicate with speakers from the other community. Kadu and Kanan people also
	have strong separate identities and have a desire to have separate literature.
	In addition, Myanmar's official list of ethnic groups lists Kadu and Kanan as
	separate language groups.

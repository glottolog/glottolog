comment = Ruga (5350-ruh) = Critically Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ("[T]he Ruga language now appears to be moribund. A few older people can still speak what they consider to be Ruga, but the speech of those I have met is heavily influenced by Garo, and the remaining speakers admit that they are more comfortable with Garo than with Ruga. They lack the fluency that they remember in their parents. Their children, they tell me, speak only Garo, though they may understand the Ruga of the older people. I doubt if anyone born after 1950 would claim to be able to speak Ruga." (p.11-12)) [Burling 2004](elcat:46a4378f835dc8040c8057beb6a2da52)

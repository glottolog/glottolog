comment = Galo (5631-adl) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ("...the Galo remain overwhelmingly dominant in their area, their language is
	spoken daily and learned as a first language by a majority of children (though certainly
	not by all).... However, changes in this comfortable status quo are already apparent. With
	improvements in communication, economic opportunities, and the reach of regional,
	national and even international media into Arunachal Pradesh, Galo are increasingly
	relying on more widely spoken Indo-European languages – usually Hindi and Assamese,
	but also English – when leaving their immediate home surroundings." (pg. 63)) [Post 2007](elcat:b4e267d84075f66ebd967d95331fcc03)

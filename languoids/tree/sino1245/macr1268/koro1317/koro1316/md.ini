comment = The Koro-Aka language (**hh:w:Anderson:Koro-Aka**), a Siangic language of
	Arunachal Pradesh, is missing from E16. (The Hruso [hru] entry mentions Koro (as
	Aka) with the incoherent claim that it is a
	'dialect' that shares 9% of its vocabulary with Hruso [hru]. This information is
	presumably a misinterpretation of the unpublished 2005
	survey (**hh:hwsoc:Abrahametal:WArunachal**), which correctly identified Aka as
	a separate language and contains a vocabulary and the lexicostatistical
	comparison with the 9% figure.)  This is the language arrogantly purported to be
	a ``newly discovered'' language by National Geographic's "Enduring Voices"
	project and picked up by many major news outlets, e.g., BBC (5 October 2010:
	``Indian language is new to science'' by Daniel Boettcher
	<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11479563> accessed
	20 October 2010). In fact, language data on Koro (as Miri-Aka) was published by
	**hh:hew:Grewal:Aka-Miji**, **hh:hew:Grewal:Arunachal** and the existence of the
	language (as a separate language) has been mentioned
	(without data) in publications several times earlier, e.g.,
	**hh:e:Sinha:Akas**:13-15. See also: Hruso [hru].

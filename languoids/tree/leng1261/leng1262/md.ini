comment = The Enxet were first contacted in 1989 by Anglican missionaries from
	Concepción; the Enlhet in 1927 by Mennonite immigrants from Puerto Casado
	(today Puerto La Victoria). Both of these groups, of European origin, referred
	to the indigenous of the interior of the Chaco as 'Lengua', even before having
	met them. This coincidence of names has led to the two ethnic groups being
	considered as a single one. In view of the linguistic differences between them,
	it has been proposed that two dialects, Lengua Sur [Southern Lengua] and Lengua
	Norte [Northern Lengua] should be distinguished. This proposal, which is not
	based on linguistic criteria, has been put forward even in the most recent
	attempts at classification (Campbell & Grondona), without comparative research
	being carried out in the field (see the extensive bibliography in Fabre
	(2005/2012)). However, on the basis of their linguistic research into the six
	languages of the Enlhet-Enenlhet family, Unruh & Kalisch (2003) have proposed
	that they should be seen as two different languages, since the Enlhet and Enxet
	languages are not mutually intelligible, and clearly distinct ethnolinguistic
	identities exist. An indicator of this is the fact that there is a considerable
	number of people who are bilingual Enlhet-Enxet.
	
	At the same time, it is not possible to understand one of the languages as a
	dialect of the other; that is, the existing code does not represent a 'major
	language'. From the perspective of the whole family, the Enlhet and Enxet
	languages are of equal standing in relation to each other and to the other
	languages of the family.

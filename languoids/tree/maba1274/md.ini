[classification]
family = No conclusive, methodologically sound basis for assigning Maban to an alleged full or partial Nilo-Saharan has been presented **hh:hv:Blench:Nilo-Saharan**, **hh:hv:Bender:Nilo-Saharan:2000**, **hh:hv:Boyeldieu:Nilo-Sahariennes** **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:294-309. The evidence that Mimi-Nachtigal is Maban is slight but convincing **hh:hv:Starostin:Mimi**. The parallels adduced by **hh:hv:Dimmendaal:Nilo-Saharan:Stable** have been selected from various modern languages and have an alternative explanation as chance resemblances until shown to be reconstructable in the various microgroups.

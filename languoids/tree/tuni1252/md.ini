comment = Tunica (8969-tun) = Awakening (While the last native speaker of Tunica passed away in 1949, The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Marksville, Louisana has been working with the Tulane Linguistics department to revitalize the Tunica language for the past two years.  Using documents produced by Albert Gatschet, John Swanton and Mary Haas, the Tunica Tulane Language Project has created an updated orthography, written Tunica prayers, and produced several Tunica children's books with accompanying recording in Tunica. Lesson plans have also been created, and the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe held its first Tunica language camp in the summer of 2012. Current projects include producing an updated Tunica dictionary as well as an illustrated dictionary for children, creating a pedagogical grammar based on Haas, and producing digital, interactive language learning tools to accompany an ever increasing number of lesson plans.  So while Tunica is currently sleeping, the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe is very adamantly trying to rouse it from its slumber.) [n.a. 2012](elcat:f28676c30d2206a40aad3a4bf668f977)

[classification]
family = Despite vocabulary cognacy of 5% or so, Pawaia was included in Trans-New-Guinea because of pronoun resemblances to Kuman and on typological  similarities. The typological similarities involve function only **hh:s:Trefry:KumanPawaian**, and thus count for nothing. The pronoun resemblances do not generalize to the Chimbu family **hh:hv:Foley:Papuan**:69-71 and match only an _n_ anyway, so they are better accounted for as accidental similarities than deep relationship.

[classification]
family = No conclusive, methodologically sound basis for assigning Central Sudanic to an alleged full or partial Nilo-Saharan has been presented **hh:hv:Blench:Nilo-Saharan**, **hh:hv:Bender:Nilo-Saharan:2000**, **hh:hv:Boyeldieu:Nilo-Sahariennes** **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:294-309. The parallels adduced by **hh:hv:Dimmendaal:Nilo-Saharan:Stable** have been selected from various modern languages and have an alternative explanation as chance resemblances until shown to be reconstructable in the various microgroups. Although not included in the Central Sudanic comparison by **hh:hv:Boyeldieu:CSudanic**, Birri is very likely a Central Sudanic language in the light of the comparisons by **hh:hv:Vorbichler:Mamvu-Balese** (I wish to thank Roger Blench, Don Killian and Tom Güldemann for insisting on the strong parallels between Birri and Central Sudanic). The Kresh-Aja group has not yet been shown to be bona fide Central Sudanic **hh:hv:Boyeldieu:CSudanic**.

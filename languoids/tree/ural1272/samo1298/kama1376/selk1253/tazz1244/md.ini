comment = Northern Selkup (8553) = Endangered (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The preservation of the Northern dialect is much better [than the Southern dialect] but still far from rejoicing. Since the 1970s the Northern dialect began to lose its positions: in larger settlements with the bulk of the population formed by newcomers from different parts of Russia and Selkups being a minority it is rarely spoken even in purely Selkup families (and one third of all Selkup families in the district are mixed being Selkup-Russian, Selkup-Ukrain, etc.) and its natural transmission from parents to children practically stopped. In small villages where Selkups constitute the majority of the population (Ratta, Pur Tolka) natural transmission of the language from parents to children is still preserved. To-day the functioning of Selkup is strongly connected with traditional activities of the population, especially reindeer herding.) [Kazakevich 2005](elcat:58a97c95c23b3d8e1567d444c1e024a0)

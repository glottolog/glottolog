comment = Northern Khanty (8550) = Threatened (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Northern Khanty is reportedly still being used in many families as an idiom of internal communication, though Russian is universally learnt as the dominant language; native language skills are, however, often destroyed by the unifying boarding school system, operating in Russian only.)

comment = Eastern Khanty (8552) = Critically Endangered (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The recent survey... shows that Eastern Khanty dialects... [are] being used increasingly less as means of daily communication. There are almost no child speakers, and only the older generation preserves knowledge of the language. There are, however, members of the Khanty communities, who maintain a strong ethnic identity, and who initiate and welcome efforts aiming at preserving their cultural and linguistic heritage, and are eager to assist linguistic researchers in the area.)

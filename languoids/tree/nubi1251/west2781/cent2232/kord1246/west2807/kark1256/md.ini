comment = Karko (Sudan) (1857-kko) = Endangered (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The people in Karko are not using the Karko language in all domains. Children playing together, young people, and men mostly speak Arabic. Women and people working together use both Arabic and Karko. When people from Karko meet each other in a nearby town, they tend to use Arabic. Children first learn Arabic, although they hear Karko. During the surveyor’s visit, an adult asked a child in the group something in Karko, and she said she understood but could not repeat it.  Karko is not heard on the radio. It is used in development meetings, but Arabic is also used. Both Arabic and Karko are used by the people of the village with their families, friends in the village, and at the market. Karko is used with village leaders, but it is not considered to be 'pure' because it is mixed with Arabic. Karko is used at funerals, social gatherings, and when singing traditional songs... Karko may be undergoing language shift to Arabic and may not remain a viable language.) [Krell 2012](elcat:87215faf25dd3a743e01d082a7787fe4)

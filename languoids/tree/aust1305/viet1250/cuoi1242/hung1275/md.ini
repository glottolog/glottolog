	The Karìì and Phòòngq languages are mutually intelligible - that is they may be regarded as dialects of a single language. Ethnologue.com has no entry for Karìì but it may correspond to the language listed as Arem (although the information supplied there differs in some ways from that given here) [I don't see how it equals the Arem entry so I'll have it as Phong- HH]

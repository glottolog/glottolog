[classification]
family = Includes Abau, Yellow River, Iwam, Ram (Pouye, Karawa, Awtuw), Wogumusin-Chenapian, Tama, Kwoma-Kwanga (Kwoma, Kwanga, Mende), Sepik Hill for which the pronouns, gender markers as well as dative, locative marker and benefactive verb are largely cognate **hh:hv:Foley:Sepik-Ramu**:126-139 and/or there are significant lexical relations **hh:hvw:ConradDye:USepik**:12-14. The Ndu languages do not show cognate pronouns or gender markers, and there is there is a detailed refutation of the evidence so far presented that Ndu is related to Kwoma-Kwanga (or the rest of Sepik) **hh:g:Aikhenvald:Manambu** (see also **hh:e:HaberlandSeyfarth:Korowori**:27 on the lexicostatistical evidence). Yerakai shares no significant lexical relations with any Sepik language **hh:hvw:ConradDye:USepik**:14, except Ndu **hh:hv:Laycock:Sepik**:23, but these are arguably loans from the adjacent Iatmul (as of intermarriage) **hh:hvw:ConradDye:USepik**:14. No other argument for a Sepik affiliation in offered **hh:hvld:LaycockZGraggen:Sepik-Ramu**:738 and Yerakai is not mentioned in Foley's re-consideration of the Sepik family **hh:hv:Foley:Sepik-Ramu**. Similarly, there is no evidence that Biksi is Sepik since nothing significant was presented **hh:hvld:LaycockZGraggen:Sepik-Ramu** and the lexical evidence does not warrant it **hh:hvw:ConradDye:USepik**. The Bikaru-Bragge wordlist in **hh:hvw:ConradLewis:USepik** presumably represents the Pikaru dialect of Bisorio (an Engan language) despite the divergence of the two, since the body part terms agree and the elicitation sessions were monolingual.

	A major confusion in E16/E17/E18/E19 is with the languages called Karipuna. In addition to Karipuna Creole French [kmv] (an entry which is correct), there are two entries, both classified as Tupi-Guarani, Subgroup VI:
	
	| p{4cm}} | Karipúna [kgm] | Karipuna [kuq] |
	| Region: | Amapá, on French Guiana border | Rondônia, Acre, banks of Jaru, Jamery, Urupa, Cabecciras, Candeias, and Jaciparana rivers. |
	| Classification: | Tupi, Tupi-Guarani, Subgroup VI | Tupi, Tupi-Guarani, Subgroup VI |
	| Alternate names: | Karipúna do Amapá, Karipúna do Uaçá | Caripuna, Jau-Navo, Juanauo, Kagwahiva, Karipuná de Rondônia, Karipuná do Guaporé |
	| Population: | Extinct. | 14 (2004 ISA). |
	| Language use: | Shifted to Karipúna Creole French [kmv]. | Some may also use Tenharim [pah] |
	
	
	Early references to the Karipuna (or similar names) of Amapá refer to a variety of Palikúr [plu]
	(**hh:he:GalloisRicardo:Amapa-Norte-Para**:62). The language of the Karipuna of Amapá in this sense is attested with a short wordlist,
	and is indeed a Palikúr [plu] variety (**hh:w:Loukotka:Inedits**).
	More recent references to the Karipuna of Amapá refer to an immigrant group whose original language is not attested, but, is reported to have been Nheengatu [yrl] (**hh:e:Arnaud:Uaca**,
	**hh:he:GalloisRicardo:Amapa-Norte-Para**:62).  Except for the classification and the fact that Nheengatu [yrl] already has an entry,
	the Karipúna [kgm] entry is consistent with referring to the more recent Karipuna of Amapá. Thus, whatever it refers to, the same language already has a different E16/E17/E18/E19 entry, either Palikur [plu]
	or Nheengatu [yrl].
	
	Until the 1950s (**hh:e:Leonel:Urueu-au-au**:40-45, 199-213) the only language called Karipuna in the Madeira-Guaporé region was a Panoan language also known as Jau-Navo, amply attested in wordlists
	(**hh:hw:Rondon:Silvicolas**, **hh:hv:deCrequi-MontfortRivet:Pano**, **hh:hw:Martius:Brasiliens**, **hh:w:Hanke:Karipuna**). However,
	the name started to be applied to groups of hostile indians at the Mutumparaná and Jaciparaná which were contacted in the 1950-1970s
	(**hh:e:Kastner:Urueuwauwau**:104) and turned out to speak a Tupi-Guarani language of Subgroup VI
	(**hh:hv:Mello:Tupi-Guarani:2000**, **hh:w:Monserrat:Amondawa**, **hh:w:Betts:Kagwahiva**),
	which we may call Kawahib. FUNAI frivolously used the name Karipuna for this Kawahib group (**hh:e:Leonel:Urueu-au-au**:45), encouraging the confusion we now observe. The Karipuna [kuq] entry mixes information from the Panoan Karipuna (e.g., the name Jau-Navo) and the Kawahib Karipuna (e.g., the classification). The Panoan Karipuna is otherwise missing from E16/E17/E18/E19 whereas the Kawahib Karipuna speak the same language as the language of several other entries. See also: Tenharim [pah].

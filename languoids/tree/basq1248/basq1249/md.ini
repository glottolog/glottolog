comment = Navarro-Labourdin is just a dialect of Basque, and so is asserted by all
	speakers from the Low Navarrese and Labourdin regions from the first written
	records in 16th century to the present. Nobody identifies his or her language as
	"Navarro-Labourdin". All their putative speakers uniformly self-identify as
	Basque speakers. The term "Navarro-Labourdin" refers to a written variety of
	Basque used in the French part of the Basque Country in the first part of the
	20th century. The name was coined by Pierre Lafitte (1944) before the Basque
	Academy had developed a standard variety for the language. In his book, Lafitte
	crucially refers to "literary Navarro-Labourdin" as a specific Basque variety,
	used by some Basque writers from the regions of Labourd and Low Navarre, in the
	French Basque Country, not as a different language from Basque. From 1964 there
	is a standard Basque ("euskara batua" or unified Basque), which is the language
	taught in most schools, including those in the French Basque Country, and used
	in the media and official documents of the Basque Country.

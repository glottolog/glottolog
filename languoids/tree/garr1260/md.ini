comment = The languages were probably misanalyzed as dialects of a single language
	because, as Breen admits "Garrwa and Wanyi are superficially very similar"
	(2003: 426). He concludes an extensive comparison of the two languages by saying
	"The many correspondences in grammar, especially the pronoun inventories,
	confirm the conclusion that these languages are closely related, but at the same
	time the substantial differences in grammar suggest that they must be mutually
	unintelligible -- closely related languages rather than dialects of a language"
	(2003: 454).
	
	Garrwa and Wanyi have about 50% shared lexicon, either identical words or
	confirmed cognates. Nominal morphology is more or less similar but by far the
	most significant difference is the verbal system. Wanyi has no evidence of the
	clitic system that Garrwa uses to express TAM, and prefers a richer verb
	conjugation to express these instead. Belfrage (2003) corroborates these
	conclusions of Breen, and while he revises the verb analysis so that the two
	languages resemble each other even further, he maintains the assertion that the
	languages are distinct.
	
	Perhaps contributing to the confusion is the asymmetrical distribution of the
	two: they both occupy areas about the same size, but per Walsh (1981) Garrwa had
	"300+" speakers while Wanyi had a questionable "10?". Moreover, Walsh recognizes
	the dichotomy and goes so far as to list Garrwa and Wanyi as distinct subgroups
	within a larger family. As Breen (2003) explains, the situation is more complex
	than it seems on the surface. Garrwa in fact has two or three true
	dialects--Western Garrwa and Eastern Garrwa, the latter of which may or may not
	be distinguishable from another variety called Kunindirri (2003: 426).
	
	In terms of higher-level organization, Austin mentions that "The two
	closely-related languages Garawa and Wanyi are spoken in an area immediately
	north of Wagay. In vocabulary and morphology they are very different from all
	the languages discussed above, and are classified as members of a distinct
	language family by O'Grady et al" (1981: 327). Breen calls this family "Yanyi,"
	explaining "I have used the name Yanyi (the word for 'language' in these
	languages) for the group for a number of years... and propose this as a name for
	the group that makes no implications regarding its status and does not imply
	primacy for either language" (2003: 426).

[classification]
family = I have not been able to replicate the lexicostatistic argument for a relation
	between all Timor-Alor-Pantar languages, i.e. with East Timor
	**hh:hvw:Stokhof:Alor**, and the correspondes adduced in
	**hh:hv:Schapperetal:Timor-Kisar** are suggestive but so far too few to conclude a
	relationship. The lexical and pronominal evidence for a Trans New Guinea
	affiliation is much too weak **hh:hv:Pawley:TNG**:683, **hh:hv:Holtonetal:Alor**, cf.
	**hh:hv:Pawley:Chequered-TNG**:94-95. The newest comparison of cognates
	**hh:g:Kratochvil:Abui**:6-11 cannot muster a strong case (correspondences are few,
	weak and not systematic enough).

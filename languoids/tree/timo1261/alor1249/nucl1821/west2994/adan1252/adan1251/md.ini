comment = Adang (9470-adn) = Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Some situational variations or registers of Adang like pohang, pepel and baneharl no longer exist. Only two or three Adang speakers still have the knowledge of these language varieties. These varieties are no longer used in gatherings or events where they were formerly used. Such events are, for example, harvesting time for 'pepel' and also 'pohang'. One variety of Adang normally found in a traditional dance called 'holeng holeng' seems to have become extinct with the loss of the traditional dance itself.) ['bib3189']

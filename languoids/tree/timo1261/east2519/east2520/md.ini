[classification]
family = The group is clearly internally coherent. I have not been able to replicate the lexicostatistic argument for a relation between all Timor-Alor-Pantar languages, i.e.~with West Timor-Alor-Pantar and Kolana-Tanglapui Stokhof 1975, and suggested correspondences do not show much systematicity. Likewise, the Bomberai/Alor comparisons in Hull 2004 are flimsy.

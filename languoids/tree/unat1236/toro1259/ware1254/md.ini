[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Wares [wai] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a separate Tor language, referring
	to the warlike tribe on the upper Biri river
	(**hh:hew:Oosterwal:Tor**:26-27).  The Wares themselves had to flee to the coast
	from their original territory in the 1950s, possibly returned
	(**hh:hew:Oosterwal:Tor**:26-27) and have been heard of since
	(**hh:e:Koentjaraningrat:Bgu**,
	**hh:e:Koentjaraningrat:Pantai-Utara**:135-136), but no separate Wares language
	has been found in old or recent surveys
	(**hh:h:vanderLeeden:Sarmische**, **hh:hw:SmitsVoorhoeve:Anceaux:B:I**,
	**hh:ld:Grace:23**, **hh:wsoc:Wambaliau:Mawes**)
	-- in particular, the only language found at the village Wares, is that covered
	in the entry Mawes [mgk]. Since there is no data and no intelligibility
	information on the Wares language, we cannot assert that they spoke language
	different from all others (let alone a Tor language) even if the ethnic group
	was (and still may be) extant. See also: Mawes [mgk].

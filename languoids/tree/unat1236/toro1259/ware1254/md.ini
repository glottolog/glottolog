[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Wares [wai] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24 as a separate Tor language, referring to the warlike tribe on the upper Biri river
	(**hh:hew:Oosterwal:Tor**:26-27).  The Wares themselves had to flee to the coast from their original territory in the 1950s, possibly returned (**hh:hew:Oosterwal:Tor**:26-27) and have been heard of since (**hh:e:Koentjaraningrat:Bgu**,
	**hh:e:Koentjaraningrat:Pantai-Utara**:135-136), but no separate Wares language has been found in old or recent surveys
	(**hh:h:vanderLeeden:Sarmische**, **hh:hw:SmitsVoorhoeve:Anceaux:B:I**, **hh:ld:Grace:23**, **hh:wsoc:Wambaliau:Mawes**)
	-- in particular, the only language found at the village Wares, is that covered in the entry Mawes [mgk]. Since there is no data and no intelligibility information on the Wares language, we cannot assert that they spoke language different from all others (let alone a Tor language) even if the ethnic group was (and still may be) extant. See also: Mawes [mgk].

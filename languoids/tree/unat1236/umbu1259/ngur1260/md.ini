[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 has an entry for Ngurmbur [nrx] following information given by speakers of neighbouring languages that a tribe with this name were prevalent in a certain territory (as per maps like **hh:g:Harvey:Limilngan**:xii).  However, only second hand meta-reports are available on the supposed language, and was said to be similar to Umbugarla [umr] (**hh:s:Davies:Umbugarla**).
	Consequently, it cannot be asserted that Ngurmbur [nrx] was a separate language. See also: Umbugarla [umr].

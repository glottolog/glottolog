[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22 has two entries Lumbee [lmz] and Carolina Algonquian
	[crr], both classified as Algonquian. However, there is only one securely attested language in that region which is Algonquian, and that is the one represented by the vocabularies in
	**hh:w:Hariotetal:Roanoke**, **hh:w:Geary:Pamlico**. E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22 is either wrong in a) having two entries for the same language or b) wrong in calling Lumbee an Algonquian language (Lumbee, in modern times, can be understood to refer to a variety of English, see
	**hh:socdial:WolframDannenberg:Lumbee**). I wish to thank Ives Goddard for discussing this entry with me. See also: Carolina Algonquian [crr].

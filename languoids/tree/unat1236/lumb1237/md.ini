[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has two entries Lumbee [lmz] and Carolina Algonquian
	[crr], both classified as Algonquian. However, there is only one securely
	attested language in that region which is Algonquian, and that is the one
	represented by the vocabularies in
	**hh:w:Hariotetal:Roanoke**, **hh:w:Geary:Pamlico**. E16/E17/E18/E19 is either
	wrong in a) having two entries for the same language or b) wrong in calling
	Lumbee an Algonquian language (Lumbee, in modern times, can be understood to
	refer to a variety of English, see
	**hh:socdial:WolframDannenberg:Lumbee**). I wish to thank Ives Goddard for
	discussing this entry with me. See also: Carolina Algonquian [crr].

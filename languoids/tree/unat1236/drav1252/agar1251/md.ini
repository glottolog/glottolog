[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Agaria [agi] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 as a Munda language. First of all, the entry conflates information from different tribes with a similar sounding name (**hh:e:Crooke:Agaria**). Second there is no attested Agaria language (**hh:e:Elwin:Agaria**:xxvii) so any suspicions that they spoke a Gond (Dravidian!) language
	(**hh:e:Dimaggio:Agaria**, **hh:e:RussellHiralal:Agaria**) is undemonstrable. E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 lists Agoria as a dialect name which seems to explain how the erroneous Munda affiliation came into place. It seems that E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 confused Agaria with ``Aghoria'', an alternative name for the neighbouring group Asur who, like the Agaria, are iron-smelters (**hh:hew:Dalton:Bengal**,
	**hh:e:Elwin:Agaria**:xxvii). Asuri [asr], which is an attested Munda language (**hh:ld:Konow:Asuri**), is already listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26. This makes Agaria [agi] a spurious entry in any corrected reading of it since Asur is already listed in the E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 and the assumed Dravidian-descendent Agaria language is not attested. See also: Asuri [asr].

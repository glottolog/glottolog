[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Kontan치wa (Panoan, thought to be extinct until 2002) is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 **hh:hsoc:deAguiar:Panoan**:40. However, no linguistic data has been published to contradict or verify that Kontan치wa is a different language (as opposed to merely a dialect of a different ethnic group, or a different ethnic group who no longer speak their ancestral language) from other Nawa-languages (**hh:hsoc:deAguiar:Panoan**, **hh:he:Tastevin:Jurua**). If not a distinct language, Kontan치wa should at least be included as a dialect of another language.

comment = This is a name that was used to refer to a group of several different
	uncontacted groups. It is no longer used to refer to this group because it is
	now known that there are four separate, now identified groups that fell under
	this label (see http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/Sonja/RF/Ukpr/Report34.htm).
	
	These groups are: Harakmbet--two languages, Amarakaeri [amr] and Huachipaeri
	[hug]; Kulina [cul]; Amahuaca [amc]; and Yawanawa [ywn]

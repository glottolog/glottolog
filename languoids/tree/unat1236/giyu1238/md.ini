[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 has an entry for Giyug [giy]. Giyug refers to an unattested speech variety of Giyug island and reports available regarding its status are all second-hand and do not necessarily indicate that the language was actually unintelligible to those of the mainland (**hh:s:Ford:Bachamal**:9). I wish to thank Ian Green and Mark Harvey for discussing this question with me.

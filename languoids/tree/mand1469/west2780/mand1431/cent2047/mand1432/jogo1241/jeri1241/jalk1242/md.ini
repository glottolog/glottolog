comment = Jalkunan (4004-bxl) = Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ("Berthelette & Berthelette (2001): Language of the home and normal village life is Jalkunan. Young people speak Blé most of the time. Use of Jula among the children seems to be growing. The older people state that their children speak Jula better than they do. Young people sometimes speak Jula even if no non-Jalkunan are present. Children sometimes start sentences in Blé, but must finish them in Jula. Young people mix Jula into their Blé when speaking.)

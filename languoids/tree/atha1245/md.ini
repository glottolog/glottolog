[classification]
family = Interesting well-analysed parallels between Haida, Eyak-Athabaskan and Tlingit have surfaced recently **hh:hv:Enrico:Na-Dene** but do not fit sound correspondences with AET **hh:hv:Leer:AET** and is not enough to conclude a genetic relationship. Similarly, the links to Yeniseic **hh:hv:Vajda:Dene-Yeniseian** is not yet mature enough to conclude a genetic relationship **hh:hv:Campbell:Dene-Yeniseian**, **hh:hv:Starostin:Dene-Yeniseian**, **hh:hv:Gerber:Dene-Kusunda**, **hh:hv:Vajda:Dene-Yeniseian-Progress**.

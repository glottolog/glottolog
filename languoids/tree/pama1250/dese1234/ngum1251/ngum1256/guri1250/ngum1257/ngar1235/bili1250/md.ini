comment = Bilinarra (5561) = Critically Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (In 2013, Bilinarra has only one ﬁrst-language speaker and is not being learned by children. Nonetheless, many aspects of Bilinarra are being maintained in language mixing. The most common language practice of middle-aged Bilinarra people is code-switching between Bilinarra and Kriol. This code-switching has fossilised into a mixed language which resembles the Gurindji Kriol spoken at Kalkaringi (McConvell 2008; McConvell and Meakins 2005; Meakins 2008a, 2011c, 2012). This is the main language spoken by Bilinarra people under the age of 35.

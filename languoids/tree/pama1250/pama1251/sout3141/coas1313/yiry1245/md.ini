comment = Yirrk-Mel is currently listed as an dialect of Yir Yoront (yiy), but it is clear
	they share a sister language relationship, but a dialectal one. Barry (2004), in
	his comparative historical linguistics work mentions "[proto Yirr], the common
	ancestor of Yir-Yoront and Yirrk-Mel" (389). The 2010 publication "Western Paman
	Languages" includes Yirrk-Mel (under its alternate name Yirrk-Thangalkl) as a
	sister language of Yir-Yoront. The AusAnthrop database lists them as two
	separate language entries. In addition, Dr. Claire Bowern has done recent
	fieldwork in the area and provided us with exact centroid coordinates of the
	area where the languages are spoken (see appropriate New Code Request form), and
	although extrapolating language relationship from geographical proximity is
	sometimes dangerous the two distinct sets of centroid coordinates in this case
	supports the claim that the languages are separate.

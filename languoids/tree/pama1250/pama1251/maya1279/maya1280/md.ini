	the area is much too far west for Mayi-Kulan and is in fact rather far west even for Mayi-Kutuna. Comparison of Lamond's vocabulary with others shows thct it is closest to Mayi-Kutuna but has a number of items that are typically Mayi-Kulan (and Mayi-Yapi) and others that are typically Mayi-Thakurti. Counts show a 63 percent correspondence with other Mayi-Kutuna material

comment = Language surveys completed in 2007 identified Muko-Muko as a dialect of
	Minangkabau, with a shared ethnolinguistic identity, shared culture, and shared
	comprehension. The neighboring variety, Pekal [pel], was reportedly
	incomprehensible.
	
	Muko-Muko shares the same phonological innovations as the Minangkabau dialects
	to the immediate north of it. The survey respondents stated they identified
	themselves as being part of the Minangkabau linguistic grouping and can
	understand more central dialects of Minangkabau. Muko-Muko was listed as a
	dialect of Minangkabau in Wurm and Hattori (1981) but the Ethnologue has it as a
	distinct language. The Wurm and Hattori map for southern Sumatra has Muko-Muko
	delineated with a dashed line inside the Minangkabau solid line, showing a
	dialect. The WIST survey of 2007 confirmed the ethnolinguistic identity of the
	Muko-Muko as being part of the Minangkabau grouping. The Pekal, also shown in
	the Wurm and Hattori atlas as a dialect of Minangkabau, did not have this same
	self identity, but identified themselves more with the Malayic varieties to the
	south of Bengkulu. Southern Sumatra survey report forthcoming.

comment = Reo Ra’ivavae (11023) = Endangered (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The Ra’ivavae population is undergoing language shift to Tahitian and there exists some degree of multilingualism on the island with French as well. While the exact degree of endangerment is unclear, the language is under threat and urgently requires significant study as there is as of yet very little documentation or description of the language... No formal language-use survey has been conducted yet, but based on the authors’ firsthand observations, the majority of children are no longer learning Reo Ra’ivavae at home... there is clear language shift ongoing in all districts.)

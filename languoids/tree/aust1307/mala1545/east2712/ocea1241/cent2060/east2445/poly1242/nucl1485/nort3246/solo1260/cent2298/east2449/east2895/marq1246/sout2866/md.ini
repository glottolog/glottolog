comment = South Marquesan (2607-mqm) = Threatened (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (In many areas, particularly the more urbanized ones, children do not acquire Marquesan as their first language. In urban areas, Most children under the age of fifteen have acquired French as their first language and have little or no competence in Marquesan. In smaller valleys children under the age of ten are often addressed in French and may have only a passive knowledge of Marquesan. In areas where Marquesan is still used as a home language schooling is only assured until age eight or nine. At that age children leave their home valley and attend secondary school in urbanized areas where French is the lingua franca.) [Cablitz 2006](elcat:87ca4eb840b6f78e3b6d6b418c0fef40)

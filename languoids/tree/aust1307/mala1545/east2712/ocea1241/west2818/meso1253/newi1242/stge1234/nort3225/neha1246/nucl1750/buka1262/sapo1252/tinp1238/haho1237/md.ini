comment = Hahon (10310-hah) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (All age groups use the language, although the knowledge of the language of younger generations shows greater influence of Tok Pisin. The language is being passed on to most children, although in a minority of families this is not the case. Probably 85%% of the new born population learn Hahon as a first language. Speaker numbers are probably not declining, although the language is undergoing marked change due to contact with Tok Pisin.) [Palmer 2014](elcat:802c2bb6778f847b9a59c7194ce50d28)

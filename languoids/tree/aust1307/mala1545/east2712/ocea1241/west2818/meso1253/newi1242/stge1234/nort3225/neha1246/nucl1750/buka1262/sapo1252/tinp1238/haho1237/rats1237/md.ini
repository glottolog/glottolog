comment = Ratsua (10309) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Assumed to be similar to the situation of neighboring Hahon, where all age groups use the language, but the knowledge of the language of younger generations shows greater influence from Tok Pisin. Speaker numbers may not be declining, but the language is undergoing marked change due to contact with Tok Pisin. Consultant felt that the language is not strong.)

comment = The Tangga language is said to be spoken in three different locations; the
	Tangga Islands, the Feni Islands, and mainland New Ireland, PNG. A 2005 survey
	conducted by SIL-PNG showed that the three varieties spoken in the three
	locations consider themselves distinct, though sharing a common history. Even
	though all three groups say there was a time when they all spoke the same
	language, now they no longer understand each other. (Please note the
	accompanying survey report is a draft.)
	
	This is shown through a lexicostatistic comparison, where Fanamaket scores an
	average of 69 with Warwar Feni, highest is a 70, and an average of 69 with Niwer
	Mil, highest a 69 (see pages 16 and 17 of the accompanying survey report).
	
	This is verified by the reported comprehension between the varieties. Speakers
	of Warwar Feni and Niwer Mil said that children understand very little or
	nothing of the Fanamaket variety, while speakers of Fanamaket said the same of
	the other two varieties. (19 and 20).
	
	The lexicostatistic comparison between Warwar Feni and Niwer Mil showed an
	average score of 83, the highest being 84 (pages 16-17).
	
	The reported comprehension between the varieties is stark. Respondents in two
	Niwer Mil villages reported that children can understand nothing of Warwar Feni,
	while respondents in the other two Niwer Mil villages reported that children can
	understand little of Warwar Feni. On the other side, respondents in three Warwar
	Feni villages reported that children can understand nothing of Niwer Mil while
	the other two villages reported children can understand only a little. (pages 19
	and 20)
	
	When asked specifically about the acceptance of language development in the
	other varieties, each said they would refuse to use them. Each group wants
	language development in their own variety. (page 22)
	
	"People from the Tanga Islands, Feni Islands, and the three New Ireland villages
	perceive themselves to be speaking different languages. They recognise that the
	three languages are related and they report that they have a shared origin on
	New Ireland, but speakers of any one dialect do not think that the other two
	dialects sound good, they do not think that the other two dialects are very
	comprehensible, and they generally say they would not be willing to use
	literature in either of the other two dialects. People from each group would
	prefer to use literature in their own dialect. Even if Warwar Feni speakers
	could understand literature in the Niwer Mil dialect, they probably would not
	use Niwer Mil materials. Therefore, Niwer Mil and Warwar Feni speakers should
	not be grouped together to use the same literature.
	
	In conclusion, for the purposes of language development, Niwer Mil, Warwar Feni,
	and Fanamaket can be considered different languages and should each have their
	own literature." (page 23)

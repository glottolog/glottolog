comment = For East Timor, we noted previously that the Galolen Language Council told me
	they have a dialect spoken on the island of Wetar in SW Maluku in then village
	of Iliwaki. I have now compared my Galolen [gal] data with the Talur wordlist in
	Hinton (2000: Pacific Linguistics 503:105-129), which was taken in the village
	of Iliwaki, and his data are 95% lexically similar with my Galolen data. The
	forms that are the same are actually identical. The forms that are different
	(e.g. names for bamboo) could easily refer to different species. THEY ARE THE
	SAME LANGUAGE. Note that SIL member Bryan Hinton shows the Talur data quite
	divergent from the other Wetar lgs (he excludes it from the "Wetar cluster"
	(p.110-111). He lists "Galoleng" as an alternate name for Talur (p.113). He
	continues (p.113), "While in the Talur language area, I was told that the
	language was the same as the language spoken in East Timor in the region around
	Manututo. This roughly corresponds to the Galoli language area shown in the Wurm
	and Hattori (1981) map of Timor. Salzner (1960) even includes Galoli as a
	dialect of Wetar located in East Timor. Capell (1944) notes, '.the language of
	Wetar is almost identical with that of the Galoli country in Timor.' .. This
	Timor connection for the Talur language could explain why it is divergent from
	the language groups of the Wetar cluster. So basically, all sources are in
	convergence. Talur should be listed as a dialect of Galolen [gal], with the hub
	in East Timor.

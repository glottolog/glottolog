comment = Central Malay is the proposed name for the language embracing the related Malay
	dialects of Pasemah, Lintang, Semendo, Ogan, Enim, Bengkulu, and Serawai Malay.
	Central Malay is the historic name for the languages found in the highlands of
	the Bukit Barisan mountains between South Sumatra, Lampung, and Bengkulu
	provinces. According to Adelaar quoting Voorheeve, the term Middle Malay is a
	poor translation of the Dutch name for these languages, Midden Maleisch, and
	properly translated should be Central Malay. (Adelaar 1992:4) Use of the name
	Central Malay will reflect these group of dialects long standing position of
	being related and sharing a common culture.

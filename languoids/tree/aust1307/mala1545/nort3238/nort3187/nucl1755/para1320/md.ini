comment = This is a case where although there is a high level of intelligibility between
	the two groups, this can be explained by the historical origins of the two
	groups. In isolated Palanan town, there was almost nobody for the Paranan
	non-Negritos and the Pahanan Negritos to talk to except each other, and they
	interacted for trade and other purposes, to the point that the language of the
	non-Negritos converged lexically (but not so much so grammatically) with the
	language of the Negritos. Lexicostatistical percentages are skewed by this
	convergence, and are completely incapable of representing the fact that the
	underlying stratum of the languages are different, indicating that one does not
	originate from the other and so one should not be considered a dialect of the
	other. The underlying substrata are a perfect match for the
	objectively-observable racial differences between the Pahanan Agta speakers (who
	are Black Filipinos, a.k.a. "Negritos") and the Paranan speakers (who are not
	"Negritos"). Despite their obvious convergence due to isolation of these two
	groups in the same area for centuries or longer, differences still remain that
	reveal the separate origins of the two groups and their respective languages,
	and the language of the Pahanan Agta in some ways remains closer to the
	languages of other neighboring Black Filipino groups (e.g. the Dupaningan Agta
	and the Casiguran Agta) than it does to the Paranan language. Besides the clear
	differences in the underlying substrata, the clearly distinct ethnolinguistic
	identities and the lack of a common body of literature or mutually- recognized
	standard reinforce the separate listing of these two languages.

comment = There are various lects belonging to the closely-related Lampung(ic) language
	family scattered throughout the Sumatran provinces of Lampung and South Sumatra.
	The term "Lampung" applies to the whole family (or the province); however the
	language family (formerly consisting of 9 Ethnologue entries) is best conceived
	as consisting of three closely-related languages: Lampung Api, Lampung Nyo and
	Komering (see Hanawalt et al. forthcoming for more details). This proposal gives
	details regarding the proposed language "Lampung Api". "Api" is a modifier of
	"Lampung" and refers to this language's distinctive term for 'what?' (as does
	"Nyo").
	
	Walker (1975) was a lexicostatistical comparison of various Lampungic lects. In
	the conclusion he delineated a number of dialects, including "Krui", "Pubian",
	"Southern Pesisir", "Ranau" (subsumed under Krui), and "Sungkai" (subsumed under
	Pubian). He nowhere stated that these were distinct languages. Hanawalt
	(forthcoming) and Anderbeck (forthcoming) validate the earlier lexicostatistic
	division of Lampungic and demonstrate how the various subgroups of Lampung Api
	(recognized by Walker 1975 as "Lampung Pesisir") cohere lexically,
	phonologically and in terms of intelligibility and should not be considered
	distinct languages.

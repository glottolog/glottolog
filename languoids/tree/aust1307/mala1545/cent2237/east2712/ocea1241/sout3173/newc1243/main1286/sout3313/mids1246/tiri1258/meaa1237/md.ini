comment = The proposed correction to the spelling of the Tîrî name is based on better
	linguistic analysis and is now part of standard linguistic practice in New
	Caledonia, as exemplified in the sites Corpus de la Parole (a summary of
	languages spoken in countries associated with France, written by established
	linguists who have undertaken extensive work in the area) and the official
	Académie des langues Kanak site. They also contain further reference to more
	full linguistic works. The specific Corpus de la Parole site page relevant to
	this language is: http://corpusdelaparole.in2p3.fr/spip.php?article105
	
	See below for amalgamation of Mea (correctly Méa) [meg] with [cir] as dialects
	of the same language..
	
	The settled consensus of NC linguistic opinon, as reflected in the Corpus de la
	Parole site (cited above), Wurm & Hattori (1981) and Grace (1976) (bibliographic
	details below) is that Tîrî and Méa are dialects of the one language. New
	Caledonian official statistics also gives a single number of speakers for both
	dialects as one.
	
	While the cover page of the Académie des langues Kanak site
	http://www.alk.gouv.nc/portal/page/portal/alk/langues lists Tîrî and Méa
	separately when listing the various languages and main dialects spoken in
	different custom areas, this because its aim is to celebrate local linguistic
	diversity. It has only a single sub-page on the language (listed under
	'Hamea'-re the name, see comments under form submitted for Méa).
	
	The composite name Tîrî-Méa as used in the Corpus de la Parole site reflects
	New Caledonian lingistic practice for names of languages composed of two
	significant dialects (eg. Nêlêmwa- Nixumwak [nee], Numèè-Kwényi
	
	I have no particular view as to which of the two ISO codes, or a new one, should
	be used.

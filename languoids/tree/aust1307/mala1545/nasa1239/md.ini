comment = Nasal (10718-nsy) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The Nasal language community of 3,000 speakers is tiny compared to its neighbors, which include large populations of speakers of Malayic and Lampungic languages, each of which is spoken by more than a million speakers. Fortunately, my own findings from a fieldtrip in November 2014 in conjunction with a recent survey reveals that Nasal is still actively spoken and learned by children in all three Nasal villages. However, the sheer number of speakers, the influx of Malayic speakers into Nasal villages, and the polyglossic nature of the community mean that Nasal is definitely endangered.) ['bib165']

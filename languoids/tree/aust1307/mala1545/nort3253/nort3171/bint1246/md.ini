comment = Bintulu (9749-bny) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The language is generally strong. Children learn the language and use it at home and with other Bintulu speakers. The social situation however, may be shifting against Bintulu. Malay is by far the main langauge of use in the town of Bintulu. Bintulu is spoken by a very small population that is almost entirely bilingual in Malay.)

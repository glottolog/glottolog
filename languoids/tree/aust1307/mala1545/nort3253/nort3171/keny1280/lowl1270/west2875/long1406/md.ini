comment = Lebo' Vo' Kenyah (10814) = Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Vitality signs vary greatly between families who live in the community and families who have moved to Miri. In Long San itself, children are still learning the language, but it is important to note that there are far fewer children overall living in the community than there once were. Most children being born to Kenyah parents are being raised in the city, where Malay is ultimately the language of wider communication.) [Smith 2016](elcat:3e01f3648f40c66276168747d96e61bd)

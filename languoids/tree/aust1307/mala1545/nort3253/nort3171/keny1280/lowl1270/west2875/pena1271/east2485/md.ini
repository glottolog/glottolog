comment = Eastern Penan (1127-pez) = Threatened (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (While the Penan are not currently declining in number—in fact their total population is increasing (Sercombe 2002b)—the domains of use for the language are shrinking as their hunting and gathering way of life becomes unsustainable. Essentially, foraging has become more of a supplementary socio‐economic activity than a means of basic subsistence (cf. Harrison 2007). Formal education and literacy training, in Malay and English, have also usurped some aspects of socialization and informal education in Penan.) ['bib6730']

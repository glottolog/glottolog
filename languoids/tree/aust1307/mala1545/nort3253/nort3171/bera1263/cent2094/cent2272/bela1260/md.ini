comment = Belait (9729-beg) = Severely Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (According to Clynes, all dialects of Belait are now threatened with extinction, with the language, like other minority languages in Brunei, being displaced by Brunei Malay. Additionally, Peter Martin reported in 1995 that more than 90%% of ethnically Belait parents interviewed reported that they used Brunei Malay rather than Belait as the language of primary communication with their offspring, who generally do not speak the language.)

comment = Mount Iraya Agta (2832-atl) = Critically Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (This group, known in the Ethnologue as “Agta, Mt. Iraya” spoke a language that was even more heavily influenced by Bikol than the Rinconada and Partido Agta groups, to the point of being indistinguishable from neighboring non-Agta languages except for a very small amount of lexicon (judging from a 1984 SIL wordlist). However, it appears that this language may now be either extinct, or down to a very small number of speakers, as a visit to the area in 2006 failed to turn up any speakers of any language other than Buhinon and Bikol Naga/Partido.)

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 has an entry for Laura [lur] as a separate language. But Laura is a ``weinig verschillende dialect van Waj√©wa''
	(**hh:s:vanderVelden:Laoraneesche**:57), i.e., a dialect little different from Wewewa [wew]. Laura [lur] is thus spurious as a separate entry, and, in any case, prohibitively inconstitent given that there are many more more divergent lects which do not have separate entries (**hh:hv:Asplund:Sumba**). Since the Laura [lur]
	entry mentions that it is ``not intelligible with Kodi [kod]'' it is possible that there is confusion with the nearby Gaura which is a very divergent dialect of Kodi [kod] which is otherwise not mentioned in any entry in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 (for locations, names and data, see
	**hh:hv:Asplund:Sumba** and **hh:hvw:Putra:Sumba**). See also: Kodi [kod], Wewewa [wew].

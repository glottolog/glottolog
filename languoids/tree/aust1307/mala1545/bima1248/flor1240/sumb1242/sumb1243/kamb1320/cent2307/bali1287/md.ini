[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = To judge from their locations, the language of Baliledu and Pondok in Sumba are counted as Anakalang [akg] and/or Wewewa [wew] varieties in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28. However, consistent reports suggest a lack of inherent intelligibility between Baliledu/Pondok and Anakalang as well as the Lolina dialect of Wewewa [wew] (p.c., Leif Asplund 2015, 2022) and the lexicostatistical figures are more consistent with two different languages (**hh:hv:Asplund:Sumba**:9, **hh:hv:Gasser:Bima-Sumba**). Baliledu and Pondok (also known as Buawa) are quite different (**hh:hv:Asplund:Sumba**:9), but appear to be mutually intelligible (p.c. Leif Asplund 2022). See also: Anakalang [akg], Wewewa [wew].

comment = Rongga (1856-ror) = Threatened (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Community-internal and community-external factors for language maintenance or loyalty
	disadvantage Rongga. The following combined factors impose heavy pressure on Rongga:
	a negative attitude towards their language, the small size of the population, unstable
	bilingualism favouring Indonesian, unhelpful national and regional/local settings (e.g. the national language policy, its non lingua franca status, low participation in regional
	politics)."   
	
	"Rongga is relatively healthy only in certain places at the moment, particularly in its core
	interior territories, e.g. the southern part of the village of Bamo, but it is endangered in
	other parts,such asin Tanarata. The prospect of itssurvival appearsto be quite faintsince
	even Rongga in the interior parts is now under serious threat due to the opening of a big
	new road and also an upgrade of the existing ones for a mining project.) [Arka 2004](elcat:53df950db87aecf09d328092faf4e03f)

comment = Dampelas (1412-dms) = Threatened (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Dampelas is used in daily life, but less so in public with newcomers and not at all in primary schools. Families are commonly bilingual, but even Dampelas speaking parents tend to speak Indonesian to their children in hopes of improving their opportunities for the future. Dampelas men in their 30s, living in Palu, have only passive understanding of Dampelas.) [Moro 2010](elcat:7b03a278ad0026d4e34d0d84453a3548)

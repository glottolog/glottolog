comment = Busoa (1410-bup) = Endangered (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (It appears that Busoa is not really passed on to the next generation. Parents typically speak to their children in Indonesian... The number of children who are fluent in Busoa was said to be minimal. I overheard Busoa children mostly playing in Indonesian, and Busoa teenagers chatting in Indonesian... with Indonesian being the language of administration and government, the road towards further decline of Busoa now seems irreversible.)

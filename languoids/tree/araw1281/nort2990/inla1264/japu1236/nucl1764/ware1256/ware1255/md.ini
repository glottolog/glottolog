[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Some confusion is related to Arawakan languages surfacing under the names Baniwa and Warekena. Four languages can be argued to exist. One language most closely related to Yavitero which may be called Baniva de Maroa or Baniva de Guainía (but called Warekena [do rio Xié) in **hh:g:Aikhenvald:Warekena**) which fits best with the E16/E17/E18/E19 entry of Guarequena [gae]. Another language called Baniva is extinct and attested only with a tiny wordlist in
	**hh:hew:Gilij:Americana**:V3:203-204 but was probably close to Maipure. Especially given the alternative name Avani, it matches the entry Baniva [bvv] in E16/E17/E18/E19. Yet another large language called Baniwa do Içana is reflected in E16/E17/E18/E19's entry Baniwa do Icana [bwi] and is closely related to (if not part of the same language as) Curripaco [kpc]. Finally, a language which may be called Warekena Velha or Old Warekena is described in
	(**hh:g:Gonzalez:Warekena**) is most closely related to Mandahuaca
	[mht] (**hh:hvw:Ramirez:Arawak**:329-349). Warekena Velha is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19. See also: Curripaco [kpc], Avane [bvv], Baniwa do Icana [bwi], Baniva de Maroa [gae], Mandahuaca [mht].

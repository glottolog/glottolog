[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28 has an entry Buruwai [asi] which, following
	**hh:hv:Anceaux:Bomberai**, groups the language of the villages Gaka and Guriasa with the language of villages further southeast such as Kambala and Edor. The two village clusters speak two different but closely related languages, of which the language of Kambala-Edor, also known as South Kamrau, is somewhat more closely related to that of the villages northeast, also known as North Kamrau and represented by the Kamberau [irx] entry. The three are mutually unintelligible (see **hh:hw:Walker:Bomberai**:8 and
	**hh:hv:UsherSuter:Asmat-Muli**:152-153) and thus a separate entry for South Kamrau is missing. See also: Buruwai [asi], North Kamrau [irx].

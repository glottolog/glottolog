comment = Dumun (2157-dui) = Severely Endangered (20 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (In 1981, forty-two speakers were reported. At present, their number is still near forty, but the language is under strong pressure from related neighbouring larger languages such as Saep and Siroi, and from Tok Pisin, the Papua New Guinea national language.)

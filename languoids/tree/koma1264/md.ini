[classification]
family = No conclusive, methodologically sound basis for assigning Koman to an alleged full or partial Nilo-Saharan has been presented **hh:hv:Blench:Nilo-Saharan**, **hh:hv:Bender:Nilo-Saharan:2000**, **hh:hv:Boyeldieu:Nilo-Sahariennes** **hh:hv:Guldemann:Africa:Classification**:294-309. Evidence for including Gule with Koman **hh:hv:Bender:Koman** is so far insufficient. The parallels adduced by **hh:hv:Dimmendaal:Nilo-Saharan:Stable** have been selected from various modern languages and have an alternative explanation as chance resemblances until shown to be reconstructable in the various microgroups. There are some more refined proposals for lexical correspondences with Gumuz **hh:v:Ahland:Komuz** but these are too few and too irregular to conclude a genealogical relationship.

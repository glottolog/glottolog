[classification]
family = A Goilalan family uniting Kunimaipan, Tauade and Fuyug is often posited based on the lexicostatistical figures reported in **hh:hv:Dutton:SETNG**:631-632. But these figures (Kunimaipa-Tauade 44 percent and Kunimaipa-Fuyug 28 percent), cited from **hh:h:SteinkrausPence:Goilala** and **hh:hv:HooleyMcElhanon:Morobe**:1076 are impossible reproduce. Modern wordlists show that these languages have little vocabulary in common that could plausibly be attributed to a common ancestor and similarities in 1P/2P pronouns are hardly sufficient **hh:hv:Hammarstrom:Papuan-Pronouns**. I wish to thank Matthew Dryer for bringing this case to my attention. Evidence for Trans New Guinea membership **hh:hv:Dutton:SETNG**:624-631 **hh:hvld:McElhanonVoorhoeve:TNG** or with other neighbouring families **hh:hv:Dutton:SETNG**:624-631 is clearly insufficient, as the lexical links so far proposed are few and show irregular one-consonant correspondences.

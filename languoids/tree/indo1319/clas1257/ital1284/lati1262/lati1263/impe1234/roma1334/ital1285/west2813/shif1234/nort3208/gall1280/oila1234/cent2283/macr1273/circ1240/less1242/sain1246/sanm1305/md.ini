[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = San Miguel Creole French [scf] in Panama is listed as a separate language from Saint Lucian Creole French [acf] which is the 19th-century historical origin of the former. The variant in Panama appears not to have been studied leaving no evidence to assert that it was a separate language from the St. Lucian parent (**hh:hv:Corne:French-Creole**, **hh:h:Marrero:Antillas-Francesas**). See also: Saint Lucian Creole French [acf].

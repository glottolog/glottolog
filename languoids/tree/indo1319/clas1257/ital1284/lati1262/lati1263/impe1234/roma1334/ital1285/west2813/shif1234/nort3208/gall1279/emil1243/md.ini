comment = The name Emilia-Romagna can be very confusing. I would like to explain why I
	think the term Emilia-Romagna is misleading when referring to regional culture
	which includes aspects such as language, customs, and cuisine, and should only
	be referred to for geopolitical reasons.
	
	Two ISO 639 codes, one for Emilia and one for Romagna would be much clearer when
	referring to the cultural aspects of both regions.
	
	The sole reason why this code exists is because in 1948 with the inception of
	the Italian Constitution, the Region of Emilia-Romagna was created. This name
	never previously existed in Italian history. Emilia and Romagna had been two
	different regions of Italy in the past.
	
	From 1815 to 1866 two historical regions of Italy, Lombardia and Veneto, were
	merged to create the Lombardian-Venetian Kingdom. Nevertheless, nobody referred
	to Milan nor Venice as Lombardian-Venetian cities, Milan still remained a
	Lombardian city , and Venice remained a Venetian city. The same holds true for
	Emilia-Romagna. Bologna is an Emilian city while Ravenna is a Romagnol city. The
	term “Emiliano-Romagnolo” makes sense only if looking at the political region of
	Italy called “Emilia-Romagna”.
	
	Moreover, there is Emilian cuisine and Romagnol cuisine. There isn’t an
	Emilia-Romagnian cuisine in Italy. The “Romagnol Riviera”, and not the
	“Emilia-Romagna Riviera”, is the famous tourist area along the Northern Adriatic
	Sea.
	
	There is an Emilian dialect and a Romagnol dialect. There isn’t such a thing as
	an Emilian- Romagnolo dialect. A counter-factual example: if in 1948 two regions
	had been created, Emilia and Romagna, no one could have ever imagined the
	existence of an Emilia- Romagnol language!
	
	Nowadays, Italy is seeing a revival of dialects, after a period over the last 40
	years when regional dialects couldn't be spoken on national TV or radio. Many
	cultural institutes were established to keep dialects alive in both Emilia and
	Romagna. For example, in Romagna the Istituto F. Schurr was founded in 1996 and
	it's still involved with the conservation of Romagna's dialect as an important
	part of the region’s heritage.
	
	Here is a brief history of the “Emilia” and “Romagna” names. Before 1948 there
	weren't geopolitical regions in Italy. There were about 90 provinces, and Emilia
	and Romagna were two clearly distinctive regions. Before the unification of
	Italy in 1861, one could find on a map only the name Romagna, or “Romagne”, the
	Italian plural of Romagna. The name Emilia, instead, did not appear. Instead of
	Emilia one could find the “dukedom of Ferrara”, the “dukedom of Modena and
	Reggio”, and other dukedoms. Historically and culturally, Emilia and Romagna
	were formed many centuries before the creation of this geopolitical region.
	People from these regions have the feeling of being "Romagnol" or "Emilian". It
	is very evident to anyone who is from either of these two regions. I know, for
	example, that I'm Romagnol, an inhabitant of Romagna, as well as any Bolognese
	citizen knows she/he's Emilian.
	
	Allow me to present some points of consideration:
	
	1) Let's pretend that Emilians are 90% of population of Emilia-Romagna and
	Romagnols are only the 10%. So one could think that Romagnols could be
	considered just an appendix of the Region.
	
	Reply: There are 1 million Romagnols in a region of 4 million people.
	
	Principle Romagnol towns include Ravenna, with a population of 150,000 people,
	Rimini, with 135,000, Forlì, with 115,000, and Cesena with 95,000.
	
	2) Some may consider definitive evidence of the existence of Emilian-Romagnol
	language as having an Italo-Emilian-Romagnol dictionary.
	
	Reply: There has never been such a dictionary. We have dictionaries of
	Romagnolo- Italiano and Bolognese-Italiano, or Modenese-Italiano (Modenese is
	the dialect of Modena, the second biggest town of Emilia).
	
	3) Could the definitive evidence of the existence of Emilian-Romagnol language
	be the mutual intelligibility?
	
	No, because there is not mutual intelligibility. There are certain features in
	the Romagnol dialect which differ greatly from the Emilian dialect; for they can
	be classified as two distinct dialects. These dialectical differences are very
	evident to a linguist.
	
	An example: atonic vocalism.
	
	Some words that in Latin were trisyllabic or quadrisyllabic (where the 'u' final
	is atonic) are reduced in Romagnol to monosyllable. The atonic syllable is cut
	off.
	
	Latin GENUCULU becomes in Romagnol ZNÒC Latin TEPIDU becomes in Romagnol TEVVD
	Latin OCULU becomes in Romagnol ÒC
	
	Latin FRIGIDU becomes in Romagnol FRÉDD
	
	(Italian: ginocchio (Italian: tiepido) (Italian: occhio) (Italian: freddo)
	
	This didn't happen in Emilia: that's why an Emilian speaker is not used to
	hearing words with atonic vowels removed. Emilians don't understand Romagnol. On
	the contrary, every Romagnol “feels” Emilian dialects as very similar to Italian
	(because Italian is full of vowels).
	
	4) Emilian and Romagnol do not share a common literature. Romagnol literature
	begins in the late XVI century with Pvlon matt. There is critical edition of the
	poem in English, translated by British linguist Douglas Bartlett Gregor. This is
	the card of the book:
	
	Mad Nap ("Pvlon Matt"): An anonymous Romagnol poem of the sixteenth century
	translated into English verse and Italian prose, and annotated / D. B. Gregor. -
	Cambridge : The Oleander Press, c1976. - 237 p.
	
	Pvlon Matt was reviewed also by Friedrich Schürr (1888-1980), an eminent
	linguist who first acknowledged Romagnol as a romance language.

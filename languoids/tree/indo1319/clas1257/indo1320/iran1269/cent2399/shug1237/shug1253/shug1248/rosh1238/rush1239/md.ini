comment = Rushani (5870) = Vulnerable (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The vitality of the Roshani speech variety is very high. All the children in the community learn Roshani as their first language and it is their only language until they start school. Roshani is the only language used in the home and in the community. [...] The vast majority of the respondents hold the opinion that Roshani will continue to be the language used mostly by their children and grandchildren.) [Beck 2013](cldf:beck:13)

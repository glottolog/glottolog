comment = Khufi (6108) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Use of the vernacular is strong and exclusive in certain domains in all locations. First, the vernacular is universally used as the main language in the home. It is always the first language learned by children and is, generally, the language of greatest fluency for all. The vernacular is always the language used for unofficial situations, that is, in normal everyday personal contact not associated with any public occasion or regulatory authority... use of the vernacular is at least stable in the community, and perhaps increasing. ) [Abbess et al. 2010](elcat:6791777bf8a1d8e902d2bcf566a24209)

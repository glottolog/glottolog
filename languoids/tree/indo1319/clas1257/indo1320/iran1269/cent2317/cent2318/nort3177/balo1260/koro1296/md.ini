comment = Koroshi (4449-ktl) = Endangered (20 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Use of the Koroshi language varies greatly among the regions where it is spoken. In the south, where Korosh represent most of the population in their communities, the language is in vigorous use by all members of the community... At the north-west end of the Koroshi language area, multilingualism is the norm: in addition to Koroshi, the Korosh here speak Qashqā’i, Persian and, in the communities near Kāzerun and Gachsārān, Lori as well. Because they are a minority in this segment of the language area, Koroshi tends to be limited to home domains; and among children, Qashqā’i and Persian are replacing Koroshi as the primary language of communication.)

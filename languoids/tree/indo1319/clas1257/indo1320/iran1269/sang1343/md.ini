comment = The lexical similarity of Ishkashimi and Sanglechi is 70%. Comprehension testing
	showed that intelligibility between the two speech varieties is marginal,
	although the Sanglechi understand Ishkashimi slightly better than vice versa. No
	common writing system and no common literature exists for the two speech
	varieties since they are oral languages. The speakers of Ishkashimi and
	Sanglechi do not perceive themselves to speak the same language nor to have the
	same ethnolinguistic identity.

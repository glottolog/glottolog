[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24 has an entry Jakati [jat] which is said be to spoken by 29,300 people in Ukraine. The alternative names, which include 'Jat', the classification of the language as Indo-Aryan, and a note indicating 'nomadic' suggests that the denotation is an itinerant population with roots on the Indian subcontinent, i.e.,
	'Gypsy' in loose terminology. 29,300 is a plausible number of Gypsies, or Roma, in Ukraine related to the Roma in countries to the west, but these Roma speak and indentify as a variety of Vlax [rmy]
	(**hh:soct:Barannikov:Ukrainian-Gypsy**:24-44,
	**hh:h:MarushiakovaPopov:Central-Asian-Gypsies**). Thus their speech is already covered by the Vlax [rmy] entry, and, furthermore,
	they do not call themselves 'Jat' and are not called 'Jat' by others.  Although they could not have reached Ukraine in such numbers as per the E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24 entry, several ethnically and linguistically different communities in Afghanistan are called 'Jat'
	(**hh:e:Rao:Jat:1981**, **hh:e:Rao:Ghorbat**, **hh:hld:Rao:Peripatetics-Afghanistan**),
	and the entry may be a confused attempt to render one of them. At least two mother tongues (as opposed to speech registers) are securely attested among the Afghanistan 'Jat':s, both of which are missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24. One may be called Afghanistan Ghorbat
	(**hh:hld:Rao:Peripatetics-Afghanistan**:74-81) and has a Persian grammar and a vocabulary from Persian, manipulated Persian,
	Indo-Aryan and other sources. The second may be called Inku
	(**hh:hld:Rao:Peripatetics-Afghanistan**:82-85) and is a language of the Lahnda group of Indo-Aryan, perhaps closest to E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24's Siraiki
	[skr] (**hh:h:Kieffer:Afghanistan**). Thus, the E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24 Jakati [jat]
	entry is either spurious or erroneous (as to location and population) and ambiguous between the two Afghanistani Jat languages. See also: Saraiki [skr], Vlax Romani [rmy].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Deccan [dcc] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28 as a separate language from Marathi [mar]. The entry for Deccan [dcc]
	closely matches the information from **hh:hvw:Grierson:7**:15, 33, 47-60,
	219 on the ``broken dialects of the Dekhan'',
	such as the subvarieties Dharwar and Bijapuri, but also contains information matching the similarly named Dakkhini Urdu variety of the Urdu [urd] (**hh:hdial:Schmidt:Dakhini**) such as the primary usage of Arabic script. The varieties of Dharwar and Bijapuri,
	though showing some Kannada influences, are essentially the same dialect as the Marathi [mar] (**hh:hvw:Grierson:7**:15, 33, 47-60,
	219, called Dekhan Marathi by him). Hence this entry is spurious either as the Marathi variety or as Dakkhini Urdu. See also: Marathi [mar], Urdu [urd].

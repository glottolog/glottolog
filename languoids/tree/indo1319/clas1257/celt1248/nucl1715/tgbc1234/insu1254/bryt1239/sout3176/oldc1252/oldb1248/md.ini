[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The ISO 639-3 standard has a separate code for Old Breton [obt]. Whatever we know of Old Breton has differs only little, if anything, from the better attested Old Cornish [oco], and together they may be said to form an old South-West British language
	(**hh:hld:Schrijver:Old-British**:4). See also: Old Cornish [oco].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The ISO 639-3 standard has a separate code for Middle Cornish [cnx]. Middle Cornish, which forms the majority of attested Cornish, does not seem distinct enough to merit a language-entry separate from (Late and Modern) Cornish [cor] (**hh:s:George:Cornish**). See also: Cornish [cor].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The ISO 639-3 standard has a separate code for Middle Welsh [wlm], separate from Old Welsh [owl] and (Modern) Welsh
	[cym].  It seems difficult to argue Middle Welsh would have been a stage unintelligible to both the earlier and later varieties
	(**hh:s:Willis:Old-Middle-Welsh**, **hh:hld:Schumacher:Mittel-Fruhneukymrisch**). See also: Old Welsh [owl], Welsh [cym].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The ISO 639-3 standard has a separate code for Middle Breton [xbm]. The substantial data attested from the 15th century and onwards do show differences to modern Breton [bre], but there is little to suggest the differences would motivate unintelligibility to the KLT dialect group (**hh:s:Stephens:Breton**:351, **hh:hld:Schrijver:Middle-Modern-Breton**). See also: Breton [bre].

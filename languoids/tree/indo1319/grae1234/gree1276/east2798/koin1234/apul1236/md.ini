comment = Two enclaves of Greek speakers are found in Calabria and Apulia of present-day
	Italy. They are subsumed in E16/E17/E18/E19's entry on Modern Greek
	[ell], noting, however that the ``Greek of Italy and that of Corsica are
	probably distinct languages''. Indeed, especially the Apulian variety of Otranto
	is not intelligible to Greek speakers of Greece
	(**hh:vld:Tozer:Greek-Italy**:37), and thus merits a separate entry. I owe this
	observation of Raoul Zamponi. See also: Modern Greek [ell].

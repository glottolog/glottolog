[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The now extinct Arman variety of Even documented by **hh:gt:Rishes:Armanskij-Evenskogo** differs from other Even dialects in that it did not partake in a sizeable set of sound changes involving initial consonants (**hh:g:Novikova:Olskij**:20, **hh:hv:Doerfer:Tungus:1978**:18-19). This and other differences make it very unlikely that Arman was intelligible to other Even dialects and indeed **hh:gt:Rishes:Armanskij-Evenskogo** mentions that some Arman speakers also know Eastern Even which would hardly have been relevant if they were intelligible. I wish to thank Mikhail Zhivlov for bringing this language to my attention and for clarifying the amount of differences between Arman and all other Even dialects.

comment = Solon (8570) = Threatened (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (the situation varies greatly, with some groups in Heilongjiang adopting other languages (Dagur, Chinese); on the Inner Mongolian side the language is generally being retained well, with children also consistently learning it) [Salminen 2000](elcat:0dad1fb03d95c7a966ba43a4a91bb07c)

[classification]
family = The Ndu languages do not show cognate gender markers with Sepik while the
	pronouns show some amount of resemblance **hh:hv:Foley:Sepik-Ramu**:126-139.
	However, with the extant variety of pronoun forms with the Sepik languages, it
	is difficult to ascertain beyond-chance relationships. The best resemblance is
	with Kwoma but there is detailed refutation of the evidence so far presented
	that Ndu is related to Kwoma-Kwanga (or the rest of Sepik)
	**hh:g:Aikhenvald:Manambu**. Yerakai shares no significant lexical relations
	with any Sepik language **hh:hvw:ConradDye:USepik**:14, except Ndu
	**hh:hv:Laycock:Sepik**:23, but these are arguably loans from the adjacent
	Iatmul (as of intermarriage) **hh:hvw:ConradDye:USepik**:14
	**hh:hv:Aikhenvald:Sepik**.

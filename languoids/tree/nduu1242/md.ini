[classification]
family = The Ndu languages do not show cognate gender markers with Sepik while the pronouns show some amount of resemblance **hh:hv:Foley:Sepik-Ramu**:126-139. However, with the extant variety of pronoun forms with the Sepik languages, it is difficult to ascertain beyond-chance relationships. The best resemblance is with Kwoma but there is detailed refutation of the evidence so far presented that Ndu is related to Kwoma-Kwanga (or the rest of Sepik) **hh:g:Aikhenvald:Manambu**:591-605. Yerakai shares no significant lexical relations with any Sepik language **hh:hvw:ConradDye:USepik**:14, except Ndu **hh:hv:Laycock:Sepik**:23, but these are arguably loans from the adjacent Iatmul (as of intermarriage) **hh:hvw:ConradDye:USepik**:14 **hh:hv:Aikhenvald:Sepik**.

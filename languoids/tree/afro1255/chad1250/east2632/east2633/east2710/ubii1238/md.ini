comment = Ubi (2595-ubi) = Vulnerable (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The Baggo [village] group were confident that the children would still be speaking Ubi when they are married and have their own children, but the Gantoura [village] men said they would speak then a mixture of Ubi and Arabic.)

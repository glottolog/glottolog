comment = Baka (Far North Region, Cameroon) (10229) = Severely Endangered (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The age range of Baka speakers is 15-90; with a significant bias towards the upper end of the age range. Estimations of the age of speakers above sixty must be taken as approximate. The mean age of speakers is 39.7 years but there are no speakers at all aged 14 and below... [Baka is] in imminent danger of disappearing.) [Blench et al. 2009](elcat:0a45c33edc375aac8a9a16a406407d0f)

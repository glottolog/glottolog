comment = Jimi (Cameroon) (4327-jim) = Threatened (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Jimi is the primary language spoken in the home, during conversations with friends, and at work. It is also used at the markets, although in Mbola, Fulfulde is also needed in order to communicate with strangers. Jimi is the only language reported to be used for public gatherings such as traditional ceremonies, making announcements, and meetings with regional chiefs.)

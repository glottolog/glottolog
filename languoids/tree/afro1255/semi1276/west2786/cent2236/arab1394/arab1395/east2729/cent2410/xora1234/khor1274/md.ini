	In terms of Arabic dialectology they have retained features by which they can be related to Mesopotamian (Iraqi) dialects prior to the so-called qeltu/gelet split and thus to the immigrations during the ninth and tenth centuries (Dahlgren 2002-03;2005) based on the criteria that were established for Central Asian Arabic by O. Jastrow (1998).
	Khamse Arabs living close to Shiraz has only recently become settled (cf. Dahlgren 2003) and
	Sarakhs
	Zir Kuh
	correlates linguistically more with the Central Asian than the Mesopotamian language variety

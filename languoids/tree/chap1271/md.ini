[classification]
family = The text analysis of Mure by **hh:hvw:deCrequiMontfortRivet:Capakura** is sound, but the parallels with Chapacuran are limited to a few words, while the rest it utterly different. Therefore, the near-identical Chapacuran words are likely to be loans, especially given that the Mure were missioned together with Chapacuran peoples.

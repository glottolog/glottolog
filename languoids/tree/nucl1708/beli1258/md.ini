comment = Beli (Papua New Guinea) (3898-bey) = Vulnerable (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (In every village, [Beli] is the language of primary importance... It is the language best known by all, the first one learned by small children, and the only one known by some of the older people... The overwhelming majority felt that [Beli] would never cease to be used. ... Although the use of Tok Pisin will increase, there appears to be no threat of it usurping [Beli] as the primary means of communication.) [Cooper 1981](elcat:505cceefe22f5a53a5f8d334e8222454)

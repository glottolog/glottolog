comment = Yeri (2709-yev) = Severely Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ([Speaker numbers are] declining very quickly. Most people in the village assume that children can’t understand Yeri. Although Yeri can be used to address children, Tok Pisin is more predominantly used to talk to children. Maybe 40-50%% of the village speaks Yeri pretty well. A smaller portion speaks it fluently. A larger portion can speak at least some Yeri or has passive knowledge of the language. Yeri is mostly used between older speakers (regardless of whether they’re at home or walking around in the village) or to tell traditional narratives. It’s also frequently used in combination with Tok Pisin.) [Wilson 2014](elcat:9096e8758d06ca09f42272ec19698d17)

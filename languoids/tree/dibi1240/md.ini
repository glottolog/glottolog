[classification]
family = Dibiyaso is often associated with its northern neighbour Bosavi through a small number of matching lexical items. **hh:hvw:Reesink:Aramia**:12 gives a number of lexical lookalikes between Dibiyaso and Kaluli. These contain a few fairly convincing comparisons where Dibiyasu _p_ corresponds to Kaluli _f_. The items in question are common to the entire Bosavi Watershed group (not just Kaluli) but none are found in the Etoro-Bedamini group. This suggests, that we are dealing with loans between Dibiyaso and the Bosavi watershed group. Similarly, Turumsa and Dibiyaso are said to share as much as 19% lexicostatistical similarity **hh:el:Tupper:Turumsa**, but, looking at the items in question and the sociolinguistic situation, a loan scenario is preferable to a genealogical one.

comment = Darkhat is in reality a dialect or regional accent variation of Mongolian Halh
	(Darkhad or Darhad is often used for transcription of its standard form in Halh;
	Darkhat is the preferred older, traditional orthography.) When Darkhad speakers
	converse with Halh speakers from other regions they understand each other fully
	without difficulty. They consider their language to be Halh.

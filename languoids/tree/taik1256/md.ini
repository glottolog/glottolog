[classification]
family = Jiamao [jio] has recently been suggested as a language isolate with heavy Hlai
	overlay **hh:hvwphon:Norquest:Proto-Hlai**. However, if the suggestion of
	massive borrowing from Hlai into Jiamao is in fact correct, so little residual
	vocabulary remains that it appears insufficient for positing a new language
	isolate. Therefore Jiamao is counted as a Hlai, and thus Tai-Kadai, language.

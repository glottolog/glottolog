[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Tai Long [thi] is listed as a separate Southwestern Tai language of Laos. The only identifying information is Louangphabang province and a speaker number of 4,800 form 2004.
	Tai Long (``the Great Tai'') is an ethnonym known from neighbouring Burma (and perhaps into China) to designate a fraction of the
	(greater) Shan but without a specific locality
	(**hh:hv:Edmondson:Shan**:191-192). The speakers whose ethnonym is Tai Long in Burma speak varieties falling under the entries Shan
	[shn], Tai Nüa [tdd] and Lü [khb] (**hh:hv:Edmondson:Shan**). While other sources on Laos or Luang Phabang specifically (see
	**hh:he:Schliesinger:Austro-Thai** and sources cited therein) do not feature a Tai group with the Tai Long, there are various pockets of Tai Nüa [tdd] and Lü [khb] speakers. It therefore stands to reason that the Tai Long in Laos also speak a variety of the Shan
	[shn], Tai Nüa [tdd] or Lü [khb] languages (geographically Lü [khb]
	may be the most likely, **hh:s:Hartmann:Lue**:255, 261), especially in the absense of evidence of a distinct Southwestern Tai language in Luang Phabang in other sources. See also: Lü [khb], Shan [shn], Tai Nüa [tdd].

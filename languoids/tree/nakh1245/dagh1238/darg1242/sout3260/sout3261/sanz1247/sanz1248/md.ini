comment = Sanzhi Dargwa (10988) = Endangered (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (All members of the youngest generation are dominant in Russian, but everybody has at least a passive command of Sanzhi and is able to use a simplified form of the language in communication with members of the oldest generation, e.g. in interaction between grandchildren and grandparents.... Among the youngest generation language shift is observable, and it is reasonable to assume that members of the youngest generation in particular who are still children today will not pass on Sanzhi to their children. Since Sanzhi Dargwa is not employed in the public domain (e.g. administration, education, media, court) the language is unwritten and used only for oral communication within the Sanzhi community.)

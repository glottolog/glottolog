[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The three Southern Akhvakh dialects are traditionally counted as one language with Northern Akhvakh in the Akhvakh [akv] entry. However, at least Tsegob is not intelligible to Northern Akhvakh (**hh:s:Magomedbekova:Axvaxskij:2000**:307-308) and thus a separate entry Southern Akhvakh is necessary. See also: Northern Akhvakh [akv].

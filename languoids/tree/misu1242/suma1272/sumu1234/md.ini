comment = I copy from Thomas Michael Green (see reference, page 10): "Ulwa is the
	southernmost surviving member of the Sumu language subfamily. It is not mutually
	intelligible with its northern Sumu neighbor, the Mayangna language, whose
	modern dialects are Panamahka and Tuahka of Nicaragua (see von Houwald 1980,
	Norwood 1987 and 1997) and Tawahka of Honduras (Benedicto and Hale 1998)".

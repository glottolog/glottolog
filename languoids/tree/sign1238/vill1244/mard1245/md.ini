comment = Mardin Sign Language (2053) = Severely Endangered (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ([Mardin SL] is mainly used at home and at family gatherings such as weddings. The language is highly endangered and not acquired by children any more... Most of the fluent MarSL users are in their 50s and 60s.) [Dikyuva 2012](elcat:c508d2d25cbf7973df444519833db0a0)

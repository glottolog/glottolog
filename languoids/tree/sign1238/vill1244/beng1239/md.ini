comment = Kata Kolok (2032-bqy) = Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Deaf villagers use signs to communicate with their hearing relatives, as well as many of their hearing friends and colleagues, and at least 57% of Bengkala’s hearing population can understand and use Kata Kolok with varying degrees of proficiency. All Deaf children in Bengkala receive linguistic input from birth, and thus language acquisition begins at birth. Intergenerational transmission is difficult to measure, the majority of signers are hearing, but on the other hand, Deaf children receive input from birth. However, intermarriage has decreased the number of Deaf children born to signers of Kata Kolok, and there have been no Deaf children born in the village since 2005.)

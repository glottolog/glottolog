[classification]
sub = Historical records and lexical comparisons show that both Malaysian Sign Language [mala1412] and Selangor Sign Language [sela1253] derive from ASL (**hh:hsoc:Hurlbut:Signed-Malaysia**). Lexicostatistical figures (**hh:hv:Hurlbut:Signed-Indonesia**) show that many Indonesian Deaf School sign varieties (perhaps divisible into Jakartan Sign Language [indo1291] and Yogyakarta Sign Langauge [yogy1234]) are part of the same family, even if the historical connection is not elaborated upon.

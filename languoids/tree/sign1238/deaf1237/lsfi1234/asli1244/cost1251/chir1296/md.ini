comment = Chiriqui Sign Language (10733) = Threatened (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Although there are now some sign language classes offered through deaf associations, religious organizations, and some universities, deaf people indicate that these classes are primarily for hearing people and that most of the deaf community acquires sign language from their deaf friends.)

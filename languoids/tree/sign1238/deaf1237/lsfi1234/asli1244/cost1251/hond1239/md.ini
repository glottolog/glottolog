comment = Honduras Sign Language (7111-hds) = Threatened (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (One deaf ministry states that there was no official sign language in Honduras until the last 5–10 years; therefore, many deaf adults do not know any sign language."
	"In general, deaf Hondurans learn LESHO through deaf friends and family. Hearing people tend to learn LESHO through various classes and LESHO publications.) [Williams 2010](elcat:17d5cb893838b5dfa2c878b2795b4232)

comment = Honduras Sign Language (7111-hds) = Threatened (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (One deaf ministry states that there was no official sign language in Honduras until the last 5–10 years; therefore, many deaf adults do not know any sign language."
	"In general, deaf Hondurans learn LESHO through deaf friends and family. Hearing people tend to learn LESHO through various classes and LESHO publications.) [Williams 2010](elcat:17d5cb893838b5dfa2c878b2795b4232)

[classification]
sub = The lexical comparison of **hh:v:Parks:Sign-Language-Comparisons(**):82 shows that Honduras Sign Language [hond1239] and Panamanian Sign Language [pana1308] are each other's closest relatives and that they in turn show a slight commonality with ASL (there is also continuous ASL influence, see **hh:soc:Williams:Honduran-Deaf**:14-15). That Chiriqui Sign Language [chir1296] is also a member of this family is implied by **hh:soc:Parks:Chiriqui-Panamanian(**):314.

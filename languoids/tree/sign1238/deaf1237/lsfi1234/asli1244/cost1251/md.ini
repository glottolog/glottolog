[classification]
sub = The lexical comparison of **hh:v:Parks:Sign-Language-Comparisons(**):82 shows that Honduras Sign Language [hond1239] and Panamanian Sign Language [pana1308] are each other's closest relatives and that they in turn show a slight commonality with ASL (there is also continuous ASL influence, see **hh:soc:Williams:Honduran-Deaf**:14-15). That Chiriqui Sign Language [chir1296] is also a member of this family is implied by **hh:soc:Parks:Chiriqui-Panamanian(**):314.

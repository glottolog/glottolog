comment = Bolivian Sign Language (7002-bvl) = Threatened (40 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (...there are a significant number of schools, associations, and clubs spread throughout the country. The number of deaf signers that attend these schools or meetings is not known, however, the fact that the Bolivian Federation for the Deaf (FEBOS) was able to mobilize approximately 1000 people for a celebration on the World Day of the Deaf is impressive and a good indicator of potential vitality.)

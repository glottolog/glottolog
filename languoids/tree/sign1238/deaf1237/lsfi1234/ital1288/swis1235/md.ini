comment = Swiss-Italian Sign Language (7362-slf) = Endangered (80 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (In 2006, approximately 80 percent of deaf infants were implanted, many of them at as early as thirteen months of age and the medical staff usually does not encourage parents to use sign language with their deaf child.... The number of pupils in the day and residential schools for the Deaf has been steadily decreasing over the past decade, as the large majority of Swiss deaf children who have received a cochlear implant are integrated into classes with hearing children, usually without signing support."
	"Many signers in these more recent deaf generations have learned sign language as adolescents from the adult Deaf community.) [Braem and Rathmann 2010](elcat:38d602279b2b13a006c26591cdc58752)

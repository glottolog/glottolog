[classification]
sub = Swiss-Italian Sign Language [swis1235] is similar to Italian Sign Language [ital1275] (**hh:h:BoyesRathmann:Sign-Northern-Europe**):22 and is in turn said to derive from French Sign Language (**hh:h:Quer:Sign-Mediterranean**:98, **hh:h:Corazza:Italian-Deaf-History**). Tunisian Sign Language [tuni1249] may be part of this family (**hh:h:Kamei:Afurika-Shuwa**):47 but historical or lexical evidence to this effect is lacking in print. **hh:v:Nefaa:Tunisian-Sign(**) contains a lexical comparison to LSF (but not to any other language) but the outcome in the low 30%:s range is inconclusive of a genealogical relationship to LSF, and if so, any closer relationship to, for example, Italian Sign.

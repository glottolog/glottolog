[classification]
sub = Danish Sign Language [dani1246], Icelandic Sign Language [icel1236] and Norwegian Sign Language [norw1255] are lexically and historically related (**hh:h:Thorvaldsdottir:Sign-Scandinavia**, **hh:h:Schroder:Norwegian-Sign**). Historical and some meagre lexical evidence suggests that Madagascar Sign Language [mada1271] derives from a Norwegian Sign Language introduced in the 1960s (**hh:vld:Minoura:Norwegian-Malagasy-Sign**). The Danish-Icelandic subgroup can be established on lexical comparison (63%, **hh:hv:AlderssonMcEntee:Icelandic-Danish**) and historical evidence (**hh:h:Thorvaldsdottir:Sign-Scandinavia**):812.

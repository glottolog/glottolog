[classification]
sub = Russian sign language [russ1255] (including Tajik Sign Language, see **hh:vtyp:Power:Russian-Tajik-Sign**, **hh:hvsoc:Power:Tajik-Sign**) is believed to be related to LSF through recruitment of teachers in the 19th century, but unconfirmed by lexical analysis (**hh:ld:Kagirov:Russian-Sign**):71. Russian Sign Language [russ1255], Ukrainian Sign Language [ukra1235], and Moldova Sign Language [mold1243] are closely related according to lexicostatistical analysis (**hh:h:Bickford:EEurope**):40-41. Lithuanian Sign Language [lith1236] (**hh:s:Danielius:Lietuviu-Gestotyros**):10, 11, 24, 32, Mongolian Sign Language [mong1264] (**hh:ld:Geer:Mongolian-Sign**):594 and Georgian Sign Language [geor1254] (**hh:typ:PfauMakharoblidze:Georgian-Sign:Negation**:1, **hh:h:Abdel-Fattah:Sign-Western-Asia**:828) also derive from the soviet-era Russian Sign Language. Regarding Estonian Sign Language [esto1238], despite the low lexicostatistical percentages to other Eastern European sign languages and ASL in **hh:h:Bickford:EEurope(**):40-41, the specific study relayed in **hh:typ:Hollman:Estonian-Sign(**):42-43 gives 61% on a 200-word Swadesh list, which suggest that Russian Sign Language is nevertheless the closest relative of Estonian Sign language. **hh:v:Mahoney:Estonian-Latvian-Sign(**) is a detailed comparison of Latvian and Estonian Sign but inconclusive regarding a special relationship between the two (since no other languages are included).

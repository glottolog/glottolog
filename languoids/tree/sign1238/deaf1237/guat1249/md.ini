comment = Guatemalan Sign Language (7110-gsm) = Threatened (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (...deaf and hearing Guatemalans have more places in which they can acquire GSM, including deaf schools, deaf clubs, churches, Christian ministries, hospitals, deaf family members, hearing parents, LENSEGUA dictionaries, and TV programs.... It is not used in government meetings, banks, or the market place, except by interpretation between it and Spanish. Hearing parents of deaf children are reticent to use sign language at home and may even strictly forbid it. Most deaf people are required to lip-read, speak, and write Spanish in order to communicate with their hearing family members. Because of this, most deaf people do not learn a sign language until they are in contact with the deaf community, anytime between 5 and 30 years of age.)

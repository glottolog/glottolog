[classification]
sub = **hh:s:Woodward:Cambodian-Sign(**):161-162 says Cambodian Sign Language shows a 42% rate of similarity in basic core vocabulary with Modern Thai Sign Language but otherwise shows no significant relations with any other sign languages in the region. The shared vocabulary with Modern Thai Sign Language is (convincingly) attributed to documented contact in 1975–1979, since it is difficult to explain the 58% difference otherwise.

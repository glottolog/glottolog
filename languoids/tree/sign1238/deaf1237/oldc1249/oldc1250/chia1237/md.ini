comment = Original Chiangmai Sign Language (9029-csd) = Critically Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (All the users are above 65 years old. "OCMSL is currently only used in very limited social situations. Instead MTSL replaces OCMSL in almost all interaction. Because of this situation and because of the extremely small number of users OCMSL is a critically endangered sign language. It is quite likely that if documentation of  OCMSL is not completed in one generation that OCMSL will be lost to linguistic study forever, since there is currently no extensive record of OCMSL.")

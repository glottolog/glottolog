[classification]
sub = Lexicostatistical data with controls from unrelated sign languages establish an Arab Sign family (**hh:h:HendriksZeshan:Sign-Arabic**):223-224 including Egyptian Sign, Levantine and Iraqi Sign and Yemeni Sign. **hh:h:HendriksZeshan:Sign-Arabic(**):223 imply that Saudi Arabian Sign Language [saud1238] is part of this family (contra **hh:hv:Wittmann:Classification-Signees**) but the reasoning is not made explicit (though teachers are said to have been recruited from other Arab countries in **hh:h:Al-Muslat:Deaf-Saudi-Arabia**:279-280). **hh:hv:FityaniPadden:Sign-Arab(**) show that lexicostatistically Kuwaiti Sign Language [kuwa1252] and Libyan Sign Language [liby1235] are also part of the family. Kurdish Sign Language [kurd1260] is different from, and unintelligible to Baghdad Iraqi Sign language but informal lexical similarities suggest Baghdad Iraqi Sign is the closest relative (**hh:ldsoc:Jaza:Kurdish-Sign**):570-571.

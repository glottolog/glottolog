comment = The language of Marau Wawa island off the south-west coast of the Bauro district
	of San Cristoval was very different from, and unintelligible with, the
	neighbouring Bauro [bxa] language
	(**hh:he:Fox:San-Cristoval**:130-131). It is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19. It is
	now almost certainly extinct
	(cf.~**hh:w:Lanyon-Orgill:South-East-Solomon**). See also: Bauro [bxa].

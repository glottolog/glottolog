[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24 has three entries Skagit [ska],
	Snohomish [sno] and Lushootseed [lut]. The Lushootseed name (and entry) is an umbrellic one, encompassing both Skagit [ska] and Snohomish [sno] which are mutually intelligible
	(**hh:hv:ThompsonKinkade:Northwest**:38).  Thus, Skagit [ska] and Snohomish [sno] and spurious entries given a Lushootseed
	[lut]-entry. If one were to separate Skagit [ska] and Snohomish
	[sno] despite the intelligibility, it would render the Lushootseed
	[lut]-entry spurious. See also: Northern Lushootseed [lut], Skagit [ska].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Following up on the unusual geographic distribution of varieties labeled Pai Yao in the literature, Andrew Hsiu succeeded in locating the last rememberer of the Yangchun Pai Yao language in Yangchun township in southwestern Guangdong (China). Although only some 40
	words worth of data are on record, it is arguable
	(**hh:vld:Hsiu:Yangchun-Pai-Yao**) that Yangchun Pai Yao must have been a different language from its closest relative (Dzao Min
	[bpn]). See also: Dzao Min [bpn].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = An entry for Northern Hua Miao in Southeast Yunnan is missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26. It is not quite intelligible with Southern Hua Miao, represented by E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26s Hmong Njua [hnj]; this impression probably represents acquired intelligibility due to radio broadcasts (**hh:styp:McLaughlin:Hmong-Soud**:9-10). See also: Hmong Njua [hnj].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Momina [mmb] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28 as a separate language alongside Momuna [mqf]. The Momina [mmb] entry states that it represents the language of Samboga village. However, Samboga is located on the Kolff river (**hh:hvw:Wilbrink:Kopkaka**:6) which is squarely inside Momuna [mqf] territory according its entry and information on the ground confirms there is only one language in this territory (**hh:e:Henson:Melanesia**:177-180). The Momina [mmb] entry is spurious, and the result of a misinterpretation (p.c. Dick Kroneman 2025) of a cautiously formulated survey by Kroneman and Peckham 1989 (**hh:h:SilzerClouse:Index**). See also: Momuna [mqf].

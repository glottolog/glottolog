comment = Unggumi and Worrorra have been considered separate languages for some time now.
	In McGregor's 1988 Worrorran classification in his "Handbook of Kimberley
	Languages," he lists them both as separate languages. In 2009, McGregor and Alan
	Rumsey also list both Unggumi and Worrorra as independent languages within the
	Western Worrorran group (7).
	
	The Australian Phylum classification by O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin also
	treats Unggumi and Worrorra as separate languages (1966: 35). They explain that
	"the primary verbal distinction is between realis and irrealis in all languages
	in the Wororan family (except Worora, which distinguishes many moods and
	tenses)" (1966: 79). Presumably this further sets Worora apart from Unggumi.
	
	Both languages are listed independently in AUSTLANG, with Unggumi given the
	AIATSIS code K14 and Worrorra given the separate code K17. AUSTLANG classifies
	them both within the Worrorric subgroup of the Worrorran family.
	
	Dr. Bowern's documentation on Australian language locations also places the
	Unggumi and Worrorra languages in different areas, which one may see by
	consulting the following map:

	We believe that Dr. Bowern's research and expertise on languages of Australia,
	as well as the support of the sources listed below are sufficient to define
	Unggumi and Worrorra as languages distinct from one another.

comment = The name is a dialect or dialect group name, and therefore incorrect for a
	language designation. It should be changed to the general language name. There
	is almost no disagreement among linguists about what the general language names
	for Mayan languages are. The majority of the Ethnologue/ISO names are, however,
	dialect names.
	
	
	The “languages” to be merged are in fact dialects or dialect groups within a
	single language. All historical linguists who work on Mayan agree on almost all
	of the actual languages in terms of identity (there is some disagreement about
	how the family is ramified), and agree that there are many fewer than are listed
	in Ethnologue or by ISO. The ISO codes taken from Ethnologue represent some of
	the dialects of different Mayan languages, but are not even a complete or
	accurate listing of dialects. At any rate, the distinctions they make need to be
	made at the level of dialect designations or codes, not language codes. If for
	some reason it is decided to maintain dialect distinctions in the codes for
	Mayan languages instead of merging the separate codes, then each language needs
	a separate general code to designate the language as a whole rather than one of
	its dialects. The languages about which there is still some discussion are: Achi
	(most linguists agree that it is a dialect (group) of K’ichee’, but speakers
	have chosen overwhelmingly to identify it as a separate language), Cholti’
	(separate extinct language or ancestral language?), Motozintlec and Tuzantec
	(dialects of Mocho’ or separate languages?). The classification originally made
	by Terrence Kaufman and supported by the work of Lyle Campbell is that which is
	generally accepted, while the classification made by John Robertson is in
	agreement on most of the language names but disagrees on some of the family
	divisions. The list of currently accepted names of Mayan languages, arranged
	according to the family divisions and branches proposed by Kaufman, follows. I
	am using Mayan spelling for the Guatemalan languages, since there is general
	agreement among speakers of these languages to use these spellings. Language
	names are preceded by a hyphen.

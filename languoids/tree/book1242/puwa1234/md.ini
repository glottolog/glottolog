comment = Phowa speakers are classified under the Yi nationality officially and are
	affiliated with the Phula ethnic group historically. Although all varieties of
	Phowa are closely related, a complex dialect continuum has developed within
	Phowa which features numerous transitional varieties--not all of which are
	mutually intelligible (cf. Pelkey forthcoming 2008). The three extremes of this
	dialect continuum feature varieties which are unintelligible to the majority of
	the remaining Phowa speaking population, and speakers in these three regions are
	also offset from each other by three corresponding embedded ethnic
	identities--each unique: Ani, Labo, and Hlepho. These three distinct identities
	are recognized by ingroup and outgroup Phowa speakers alike and find expression
	not only in autonyms but also in material culture as is sometimes reported in
	Chinese sources such as KYSZ (1996).

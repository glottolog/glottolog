comment = The Ahwai people speak a single language on a functional level. The expansion of
	the [nfd] Ndun code element with the merging of [nfg] Nyeng , [nfk] Shakara into
	it necessitates using a name that identifies the whole group, rather than a
	single subgroup.
	
	We propose this change based on the results of our language research, undertaken
	in March 2007 in the southeastern area of Kaduna State, Nigeria. These three
	related varieties were proved to be varieties of the same language rather than
	three separate languages. The users of each variety have inherent understanding
	of the other variety at a functional level. The Ahwai people, as all three
	groups commonly identify themselves, say they all speak the same language, but
	with “different intonation”. Their claims of the similarity of and
	intelligibility between their three speech varieties are supported by the high
	lexical similarity between varieties (over 86%) and the similarity of their
	noun-class marking systems, based on the comparison of the 320-items wordlists.
	Also, although each Ahwai sub-group has a distinct ethnolinguistic identity,
	they are not antagonistic towards one another. Rather, they desire to cooperate
	in language development, and come together to preserve their common identity.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 lists Shempire Senoufo [seb] as a separate Senoufo language located in the extreme North of Northwest Côte d'Ivoire. This area is marked as Supyire Senoufo [spp]-speaking by
	**hh:g:Carlson:Supyire**:xx. The same are is marked as West Senari, i.e., a dialect of Senoufo-Cebaara [sef], in the detailed meta-survey by **hh:phon:Mills:Senoufo**:xii-xx (also followed by
	**hh:hb:vonRoncadorMiehe:Gur**:264). West Senari is reported to have 84% intelligibility to the more central dialects, but with the explicit caveat that the transition of the Supyire dialects needs more investigation (**hh:phon:Mills:Senoufo**:xiv, xvi). Thus Shempire Senoufo [seb] is either a dialect of Supyire [spp] or of Cebaara [sef], not a separate language. See also: Supyire Senoufo [spp], Cebaara Senoufo [sef].

comment = Based on word lists recently elicited, lexical similarity percentages between
	Marma and Rakhine are 62-68%. Intelligibility testing was also done by playing a
	Rakhine story among Marma mother tongue speakers in two Marma villages. The
	average scores in the two villages were 73% and 53%, indicating insufficient
	inherent intelligibility. Also, during the course of survey fieldwork, the term
	"Arakanese" was not mentioned by either the Marma or the Rakhine. Rather, the
	Marma refer to themselves as Marma, and the Rakhine refer to themselves as
	Rakhine.

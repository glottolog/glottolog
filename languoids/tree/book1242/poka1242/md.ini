[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 has an entry for Pokangá [pok] as an Eastern Tucanoan language of the Upper Tiquié river in northwest Brazil. The entry contains the comment that ``The people claim to speak Waimaha
	(Northern Barasano) [bao]''.  The Waimaha [bao] entry indeed has the Upper Tiquié river included in the list of locations. This area has been survey many times and there is no other Tucano language spoken there
	(**hh:e:Jackson:Fish-People**, **hh:es:Giacone:Tucanos**, **hh:hw:Koch-Grunberg:Betoya**)
	except Tucano [tuo] and Waimaha [bao] (also known as Bará), and the non-Tucano languages of the hunting-gathering peoples living between the larger rivers also have entries. The Pokangá [pok] entry is spurious, and should be merged with the Waimaha [bao] entry as the information in both already indicates. See also: Tucano [tuo], Waimaha [bao].

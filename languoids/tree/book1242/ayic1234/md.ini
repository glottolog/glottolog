comment = Apparently due to an error in reading Chinese linguistic sources (probably the
	Encyclopedic Dictionary of Chinese Linguistics) years ago, the name of a Nungish
	language spoken by some members of the Nu nationality group in China was
	mistakenly read as 阿依 ("Ayi" in Pinyin Romanization) rather than 阿侬 ("Anong") , and 	this was submitted to Ethnologue as "Ayi." Nu nationality intellectuals have confirmed
	that there are four languages spoken by members of this nationality group: Drung
	(which will probably need to be split into Drung and Anung/Along), Nusu, Rourou
	and Anong. There is no record of any language named "Ayi" spoken by members of
	the Nu nationality in Chinese literature or in the knowledge of local Nu
	intellectuals and therefore we conclude this is an
	error due to the similar appearance of the characters 侬 (nong) and 依 (yi).

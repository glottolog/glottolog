[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22 has an entry Tapeba [tbb] representing people of Cear√° state in Brazil with indigenous background and a common identity. However, the common identity is recently formed and does not correspond to a past or present language, as the ancestors of the present Tapeba spoke languages such as Kariri, Tremembe and likely others (**hh:h:Barretto:Tapebas**, **hh:h:Studart:Ceara**) which either have entries of their own or are too poorly known to show if they were separate languages. Since E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22 is a catalogue of languages,
	a Tapeba [tbb] entry is spurious.

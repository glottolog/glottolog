comment = Based on first-hand experience by SIL researchers, Naxi (Naxi Proper) and Narua
	(Mosuo) are almost completely unintelligible with previously unexposed speakers
	only being able to understand isolated words of the other's speech.
	
	Both languages are considered "dialects" of the same language (called Naxi) by
	most Chinese linguists, and most speakers are included in the official
	nationality group called Naxi, though Sichuan province speakers of Narua are
	classed within the Mongolian nationality. However, in Chinese linguistics it is
	common to call closely related languages whose speakers share the same
	nationality classification "dialects" of the same language even when mutual
	intelligibility is very low or non-existent. The separate identities of the Naxi
	and the Na/Mosuo peoples are well-known and documented in Chinese
	anthropological circles. There is no common literature or orthography in use
	between the Naxi and Narua speakers.

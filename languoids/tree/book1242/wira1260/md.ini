comment = Nauo, also known as Nawo, is a poorly attested, but clearly separate language
	from Wirangu (ISO 639-3: wiw). Ethnologue 16 currently lists "Nhawu" as an
	alternate name of Wirangu, but this name actually refers to this separate
	language Nauo. Hercus and Simpson investigated the little that is known about
	Nauo in their article "The Tragedy of Nauo," arguing that "the Nauo people were
	part of a chain of culturally related groups living on Eyre Peninsula and along
	the west coast, and that their language had elements in common with both Wirangu
	and Barngarla" (2001: 263).
	
	Hercus and Simpson also argue that Wirangu is not a dialect of the Western
	Desert language, but is in fact a member of the Thura-Yura subgroup (2004).
	Hercus and Simpson systematically show that Nauo is a Thura-Yura language in
	their 2001 article, demonstrating that it has some qualities that are similar to
	Wirangu and others that are similar to Barnggarla (ISO 639-3: bjb). They explain
	that "phonotactically, it resembles Wirangu, rather than Barngarla, in allowing
	initial 'ty(i)' , and 'i-u' sequences. Three distinctive Nauo properties are the
	morphemes '-yu' and '-lye', and the final vowel of the second person singular,
	'niino'. Finally, SchuÌˆrmann's observation that Nauo was vowel-final is
	important: this links it with Barngarla and distinguishes it from Wirangu,
	Mirniny, and Kukata" (2001: 279).
	
	As far back as 1966, O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin included Nawu in their Yura
	subgroup (40). Wirangu was included in a separate subgroup called Nangga (1966:
	40). More recently, Tryon has classified both Wirangu and what he calls Nawu as
	Thura-Yura languages (2007: 117).
	
	AUSTLANG follows both Hercus and Simpson 2001 and 2004 and places both Wirangu
	and Nauo in the Thura-Yura subgroup of the Pama-Nyungan family (2011).
	
	It should also be noted that Hercus and Simpson 2004 identified two dialects of
	Wirangu, Modern Wirangu and Gawler Ranges Wirangu (181, 182-183).

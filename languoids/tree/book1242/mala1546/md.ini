comment = Malay as described in the Ethnologue 15th ed. currently has several dialects
	listed under Sumatra, many of which are in other areas of Indonesia besides
	Sumatra, and of which eighteen are already listed as separate languages or
	dialects of other separate languages, or should be listed on their own as
	separate languages. Other country listings for Malay have similar issues. After
	clarifying those, however, there remains a need to specify Standard Malay (along
	with various local/vernacular Malay dialects and sociolects, e.g., Terengganu
	and Trade Malay)
	
	Aji, or more properly, Haji, is proposed as a new language; see proposal for
	Haji (Aji) for more detail.
	
	Papuan Malay should be recognized as a separate language; see proposal for more
	detail
	
	These steps will remove double listing of a speech variety as both a stand alone
	language in one listing, a dialect of a language in another listing, and a
	dialect of Malay in another listing, and also recognize the languages that
	warrant separate treatment. Goal-one listing for each speech variety.
	
	The following elaborates on the clarifications regarding the Malaysian and
	Indonesian "Dialects" sections of the current Ethnologue entry for Malay
	[Malay]:
	
	First, there should be a listing of "Dialects" not only for Sumatra but also
	Kalimantan. Jakarta, another name for existing separate code element Betawi
	[bew] The following are currently listed under Sumatra for Malay [mly] but are
	actually spoken in Kalimantan and should be considered not a part of either
	Standard Malay or Local Malay: - Borneo (Sintang), and Kota-Waringin, both
	dialects of Malayic Dayak [xdy]
	
	- Labu (Lebu, Labu Basap), exists in the Ethnologue as Basap [bdb]
	
	- Balikpapan is represented in the Ethnologue as Banjar [bjn] - Bakumpai is a
	separate code element [bkr].
	
	(moving onto dialects outside Kalimantan):
	
	- Makassarese or Makasar Malay exists as a separate code element [mfp].
	
	- Manadonese (Menadonese) exists as a separate code element [xmm].
	
	- Mulak, another name for existing separate code element Kaur [vkk]
	
	- Bangka is the proposed expanded value for existing code element [mfb]
	(currently Lom) - Larantuka (Ende Malay) has been proposed as a separate code
	element. (cf. 2007-197) - Peranakan exists as a separate code element [pea]
	
	- Basa Kupang (Kupang) exists as a separate code element [mkn]
	
	- Belide, actually a dialect of Musi (cf 2007-182)
	
	- Daya, actually a dialect of Lampung Api (cf 2007-142); Lengkayap, another name
	for Daya
	
	- Aji is another name for Haji [hji] (proposed new code element)
	
	- Papuan Malay (Irianese) has been proposed to be a new code element [pmy].
	
	There are also a few problems with the Malaysia "Dialects": Kedah, already an
	existing separate code element, Kedah Malay [meo]. Pasir Malay may refer to an
	area in East Kalimantan currently mapped as Banjar [bjn] rather than any dialect
	in Malaysia.
	
	Thailand Malay probably refers to the separate code element Pattani Malay [mfa].
	
	With this analysis, there remains a number of "local" or "vernacular" Malay
	language varieties that are not well differentiated from each other, as well as
	a number of language varieties for which further research is required to clarify
	their level of differentiation from more mainstream dialects. The following
	Sumatran dialects should be considered in this group: Tamiang, Deli, Riau
	mainland, Lubu, Akit, Sakai, Riau islands, coastal Jambi, and Belitung. Though
	not well defined, this should be considered a separate code element from
	Standard Malay.
	
	(Local) Malay currently listed under Sumatra but actually spoken in Kalimantan
	are: Sambas, Kota-Waringin, Sukadana, Ritok (Siantan, Pontianak), Sampit, West
	Borneo Coast Malay. This list of dialects would be better expressed as Sambas,
	Pontianak and Ketapang.
	
	(Local) Malay dialects in Peninsular Malaysia (mostly following Collins 1989)
	include but may not be limited to: coastal Terengganu, inland Terengganu,
	Kelantan (evidently mutually intelligible with Patani Malay), Pahang, Southeast
	Island, Orang Hulu, Orang Kuala, Jugra-Muar-Melaka-Johor. This list deliberately
	does not repeat the misleading dialect labels based on state boundaries. It also
	does not include the Malay varieties currently listed as separate Ethnologue
	entries, although some of these may be better understood also as Local Malay
	dialects: Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, Jakun, Orang Kanaq, Orang Seletar and Temuan.
	
	(Local) Malay dialects in Eastern Malaysia and Brunei include Sarawak, and one
	or more local Malay dialects are spoken in Brunei alongside the national
	Standard Malay variety.
	
	What remains is Standard Malay more narrowly specified (not including the above
	language varieties), also to be a new code element. Standard Malay (Bahasa
	Malaysia), the national language of Malaysia, differs substantially,
	particularly on the morphosyntactic level, from any described local Malay
	dialect.
	
	[RA comment: The clarification of "Malay (individual language)" must of
	necessity reference the Ethnologue entry for this language (Standard Malay). The
	current Ethnologue entry involves a large number of language varieties that
	already are or should be (on linguistic grounds) recognized as separate
	languages, along with numerous varieties that are more correctly recognized as
	being with the scope of other existing language code elements. Two new language
	code elements are being proposed as part of this refining of Standard Malay and
	separation of Local Malay from it. Because of this past confusion regarding what
	"Malay (Individual language)" should denote, and a clear narrowing of the
	desired denotation to be Standard Malay, the existing Malay [mly] code element
	must be retired.]

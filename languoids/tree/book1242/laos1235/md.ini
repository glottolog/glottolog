	without any information except its name and the country of Laos. There are two
	known sign languages in Laos: 1) Original Laos Sign Language which is close to
	Original Chiang Mai Sign Language (Chiangmai Sign Language [csd]) and 2)
	(modern) Laos Sign Language which is close to essentially Thai Sign Language
	[tsq] (p.c. James Woodward). See also: Chiangmai Sign Language [csd], Thai Sign

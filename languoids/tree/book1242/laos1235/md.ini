[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Laos Sign Language [lso] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 as a separate language without any information except its name and the country of Laos. There are two known sign languages in Laos: 1) Original Laos Sign Language which is close to Original Chiang Mai Sign Language (Chiangmai Sign Language [csd]) and 2) (modern) Laos Sign Language which is close to essentially Thai Sign Language [tsq] (p.c. James Woodward). See also: Chiangmai Sign Language [csd], Thai Sign Language [tsq].

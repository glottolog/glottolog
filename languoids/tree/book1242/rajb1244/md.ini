[iso_retirement]
comment = What has formerly been listed as Rajbanshi_rjb in Nepal, India and Bangladesh
	can more accurately be represented by using 3 different names and 2 different
	iso codes. Survey revealed 62-69% intelligibility of Nepal Rajbanshi by speakers
	of Rajbanshi in West Bengal, India. What is spoken in India is intelligible with
	the variety in Bangladesh and can share an iso code but it is proposed to give
	them separate main names.

comment = We have not been able to find evidence that this language exists. As far as we
	can see, it is not mentioned in the professional linguistic literature. The
	website of Global Recordings Network contains an audio-recorded story said to be
	in the Malakhel language; however, I listened to it and identified the language
	in the audio recording to be Ormuri [oru].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17 lists Malakhel [mld] as a distict unclassified,
	unmapped language of Aghanistan distinct from Pashto, Dari and other languages of Afghanistan. Although unmapped, the location is given in text form as ``Southwest of Kabul, Logar north of Baraki''. Thanks to the survey work of **hh:h:Kieffer:Paraci-Ormuri-SEIraniennes**,
	this location (and the fact that it is not supposed to be Pashto etc) can only match Ormuri [oru], which already has an entry. The name Malakhel ends in _-khel_, revealing that it is a clan name. See also: Ormuri [oru].

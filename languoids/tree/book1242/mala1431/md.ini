comment = We have not been able to find evidence that this language exists. As far as we
	can see, it is not mentioned in the professional linguistic literature. The
	website of Global Recordings Network contains an audio-recorded story said to be
	in the Malakhel language; however, I listened to it and identified the language
	in the audio recording to be Ormuri [oru].

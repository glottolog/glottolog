comment = Beti is actually a group name, not a language name. Language group members are
	Bebele [beb], Bebil [bxp], Bulu [bum], Eton [eto], Ewondo [ewo], Fang [fan], and
	Mengisa [mct], all of which already have their own code elements.
	
	
	In the 15th edition of Ethnologue it states that Beti "[c]onsists of a set of
	'languages' (Bebele, Bebil, Bulu, Eton, Ewondo, Fang, Mengisa) which are
	partially intelligible but ethnically distinct." In Maho 2003, Beti is not
	listed as a language in the A.70 group of Bantu languages.

comment = There is no Lamam language in Cambodia. The Ethnologue improperly moved it to
	Vietnam, but there is already a Romam language in Vietnam. The Romam in Vietnam
	is confined to one village, numbering between 200-400 people in Le village, Mo
	Rai commune. Sa Thay district of Kon Tum province.

comment = E16/E17 has an entry for Lamam [lmm] (a Bahnaric language of Cambodia). But this
	is the same language as Kaco' [xkk]
	across the border in Vietnam (**hh:hel:Bradley:EAsia**:413). See also: Kaco'

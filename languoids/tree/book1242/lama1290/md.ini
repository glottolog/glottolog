comment = There is no Lamam language in Cambodia. The Ethnologue improperly moved it to
	Vietnam, but there is already a Romam language in Vietnam. The Romam in Vietnam
	is confined to one village, numbering between 200-400 people in Le village, Mo
	Rai commune. Sa Thay district of Kon Tum province.

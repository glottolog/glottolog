comment = A sociolinguistic survey of the Suba peoples of Tarime District, Mara Region,
	Tanzania, was carried out by the SIL Tanzania Language Assessment Team in
	January and February 2006. This survey also included a short stay on Mfangano
	Island in Kenya, which is the heartland of the Kenyan Suba people and their
	language. During this time a 300-word wordlist was elicited in the Kenyan
	variety of Suba, and a 3-minute story was digitally recorded. The team then
	returned to Tanzania and spent 2 weeks researching the Tanzanian varieties
	spoken by the Suba and Simbiti peoples. In a total of 6 research locations
	wordlists were elicited and groups of people were invited to listen to the story
	elicited in Kenyan Suba. Almost without exception the Tanzanian Suba and Simbiti
	peoples had a great deal of difficulty understanding the Kenyan Suba, and all
	reported that it was more difficult to understand than the nearby Kuria and
	Zanaki languages. The comparison of wordlists similarly showed that the Kenyan
	Suba variety and the Tanzanian Suba and Simbiti varieties are distinct
	languages.
	
	Therefore the Language Assessment Team concluded that the Suba and Simbiti
	varieties hitherto considered to be part of the same language as that spoken by
	the Suba in Kenya, do in fact constitute a distinct language.

comment = A research work was done in 2001 by Annie Susan Samuel, Marshall Joshua, Mathews
	John among the people group of Arunachal Pradesh. They mentioned that they speak
	their own language Tagin along with other neighbouring languages like Hindi,
	Assamese, ect.
	
	Tagin & Sulung tribes of Arunachal: A sociolinguistic survey, NLCI 2007 says
	that Tagin and Nisi are two different languages. Nisi language shows 54-60% of
	lexical similarity with T agin.
	
	The LUAV Questionnaire finding is Tagin is used widely in almost all of the
	important domains, and the mother tongue speakers of Tagin have a very good,
	positive attitude toward it. Tagins would like to see their language developed.

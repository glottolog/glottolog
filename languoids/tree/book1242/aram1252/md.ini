[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Aramanik [aam] is listed in E16/E17 as a Southern Nilotic language of the Nandi
	group, presumably because the Aramanik people assimilated to the Nandi.  The
	original Aramanik language was a Cushitic language (or a non-Nilotic language
	with heavy Cushitic overlay) usually called Aasáx (**hh:vw:Fleming:Asa**) and is
	already counted in a separate Aasáx [aas] entry. See also: Aasax [aas].

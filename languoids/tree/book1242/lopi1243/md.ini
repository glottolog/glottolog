[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28 has an entry Lopi [lov] as an unclassified Loloish/Ngwi language of Myanmar (E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28)/China (E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28). The only unique reference to such an ethnic group is the mention by
	**hh:w:Madrolle:Lo-Lo**:544 (as Lo-pi, No-pi or Nou-pi). It is perfectly possible that **hh:w:Madrolle:Lo-Lo**:544 means that the Lo-pi speak a variety of the language in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26/E27/E28's Honi [how] entry,
	and there is nothing to assert that the Lopi speak a language mutually unintelligible to Honi [how] and other Hanic languages. See also: Honi [how].

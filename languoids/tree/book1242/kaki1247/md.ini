[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17 has a Kakihum [kxe] entry, describing a West Kainji language of the
	Kambari group, as well an entry Western Acipa
	[awc] in the Kamuku group of West Kainji.  Western Acipa [awc] is the language
	spoken in Kakihum (and the variety there could be labeled the Kakihum dialect of
	Western Acipa or _Ticuhuun_
	locally, see **hh:g:McGill:Cicipu**) and there is no different language spoken
	there except Tsuva'di [tvd] (another Kambari language -- the Kakihum Tsuva'di
	seems to be more or less identical to the Tsuva'di spoken spoken by Ava'di in
	the Tirisino and Tikula dialect areas of Cicipu, p.c.~Stuart McGill 2010).
	Therefore a separate Kakihum entry is spurious.  The inclusion of the erroneous
	entry was possibly catalyzed by the fact that Western Acipa [awc] is now known
	to belong with the Kambari group rather than the Kamuku group. See also: Tsuvadi
	[tvd], Cicipu [awc].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17 has a Kakihum [kxe] entry, describing a West Kainji language of the Kambari group, as well an entry Western Acipa
	[awc] in the Kamuku group of West Kainji.  Western Acipa [awc] is the language spoken in Kakihum (and the variety there could be labeled the Kakihum dialect of Western Acipa or _Ticuhuun_
	locally, see **hh:g:McGill:Cicipu**) and there is no different language spoken there except Tsuva'di [tvd] (another Kambari language -- the Kakihum Tsuva'di seems to be more or less identical to the Tsuva'di spoken spoken by Ava'di in the Tirisino and Tikula dialect areas of Cicipu, p.c.~Stuart McGill 2010). Therefore a separate Kakihum entry is spurious.  The inclusion of the erroneous entry was possibly catalyzed by the fact that Western Acipa [awc] is now known to belong with the Kambari group rather than the Kamuku group. See also: Cicipu [awc], Tsuvadi [tvd].

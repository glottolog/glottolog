comment = During the SIL survey in the area, the survey team gathered wordlists in each
	village that was thought to be Tarpia speaking (village of Tarpia and village of
	Kaptiau). When these word lists were compared, the results show that the lexical
	similarity between these two languages is low enough that these two varieties
	would not be intelligible (only 37% apparent lexical similarity). In addition,
	each of these villages reported that the other villages speaks a completely
	different language, which indicates that the people in these people perceive the
	other village to be of a different ethnolinguistic identity.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Bubia [bbx] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 a separate language of Cameroon. If the entry refers to their ancestral language, it is simply a variety of Bube [bvb], needing no separate entry, and if it refers to the language they are shifting to, it is a simply a variety of Wumboko [bqm], equally not in want of a separate entry
	(**hh:he:Ardener:Coastal-Cameroons**:10-12,30-31,35,
	**hh:w:BlenchMartin:Wuvia**). See also: Bube [bvb].

comment = Bubia (544-bbx) = Severely Endangered (40 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The languages are solely used by adults for everyday communication within the village or in very specific ceremonies like naming, 'born house' (i.e. child presentation to one’s community), chief crowning, burials, death celebration, etc. They are not regularly used when speaking to the younger generation, who frequently understand but do not speak the language. When asked what language they speak, many youths testify that they do not know their language, but rather speak English, Pidgin English or other languages. In the villages, the remaining speakers do not have the chance to be in contact with new media (e.g. internet), and local broadcast stations use either Pidgin English or Mokpe. The village schools use English. In other words, these languages have absolutely no chance to strengthen through the contact with new domains and settings, especially in the official domains.)

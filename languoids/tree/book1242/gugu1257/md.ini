[iso_retirement]
comment = Gugu Mini” is apparently a generic term meaning “good speech” that is used for
	several languages in the Thaypan area. The original ISO-addition request noted
	this when they cited the AIATSIS entry, which is no. Y94 in their data base.
	There are word lists under the name “Gugu Mini” that AIATSIS labels as
	“potential data”, but no confirmed new language. (See “status” below.) The
	AIATSIS entry for Y94 "Gugu Mini" is as follows:
	
	AIATSIS Code: Y94
	AIATSIS reference name: Gugu Mini
	
	Comment: According to Rigsby (2005:138), Gugu Mini is a language name whose
	reference is shifting, variable and wide-ranging and that it variably signifies
	languages situated on the mainland south of Flinders Island all the way south to
	Normanton. Sommer (2008 p.c.) says that Kuku Mini (Y94) literally means ‘speech
	good’ and in general it applies to languages/dialects of the Central Paman type.
	
	It is not clear whether Gugu Mini refers to a group of related
	languages/dialects, or simply a group of both related and unrelated
	languages/dialects. If the former is the case, Gugu Mini can be treated as a
	cover term or a language name.
	
	In this database, Gugu Mini is tentatively listed as a language name, and the
	location of this language on the map is based on Tindale (1974), who uses
	Kokomini (Y94) to refer to one specific tribe.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E17 has an entry Gugu Mini [ggm] with little information beyond this name and its classification as Rarmul Paman.  The name Gugu Mini (with spelling variants) has been applied to two distinct languages, namely the Kawarrang-Ogh Undjan cluster
	(**hh:s:Sommer:Undjan**:1-3,
	**hh:hv:Sommer:Roth-Peninsular**:133-144) and to Ikarranggal-Angkula-Alungul [ikr]
	(**hh:s:Sommer:Ikarranggal**:1-2,**hh:hv:Sommer:Roth-Peninsular**:133-144),
	but only Ikarrangal-Angkula-Alungul is Rarmul Paman. This implies that Gugu Mini [ggm] duplicates the Ikarrangal [ikr] entry and should either be removed or changed to mean Kawarrang-Ogh Undjan,
	which is otherwise missing from E17. See also: Ikaranggal [ikr].

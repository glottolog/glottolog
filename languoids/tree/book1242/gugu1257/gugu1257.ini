comment = Gugu Mini” is apparently a generic term meaning “good speech” that is used for several languages in the Thaypan area. The original ISO-addition request noted this when they cited the AIATSIS entry, which is no. Y94 in their data base. There are word lists under the name “Gugu Mini” that AIATSIS labels as “potential data”, but no confirmed new language. (See “status” below.) The AIATSIS entry for Y94 "Gugu Mini" is as follows:
	AIATSIS Code: Y94
	AIATSIS reference name: Gugu Mini
	Comment: According to Rigsby (2005:138), Gugu Mini is a language name whose reference is shifting, variable and wide-ranging and that it variably signifies languages situated on the mainland south of Flinders Island all the way south to Normanton. Sommer (2008 p.c.) says that Kuku Mini (Y94) literally means ‘speech good’ and in general it applies to languages/dialects of the Central Paman type.
	It is not clear whether Gugu Mini refers to a group of related languages/dialects, or simply a group of both related and unrelated languages/dialects. If the former is the case, Gugu Mini can be treated as a cover term or a language name.
	In this database, Gugu Mini is tentatively listed as a language name, and the location of this language on the map is based on Tindale (1974), who uses Kokomini (Y94) to refer to one specific tribe.

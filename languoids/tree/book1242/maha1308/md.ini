comment = Kenyah, Mahakam is a vague name associated mainly to toponym or ethnonym of some
	Kenyah groups. The name was proposed by Wurm and Hattori (1981) mainly based on
	what Soriente (2005:19) calls "superficial analysis focusing on geographic and
	administrative boundaries". Using the means of comparative linguistics
	methodology, Soriente (2005) is able to re-classify the variants of Kenyah.
	
	[RA comment: This Kenyah language is being requested to be retired as
	"non-existent" because it is not clear to which of the two Kenyah languages (one
	existing, but expanded, and the other newly defined) the former geographically
	specified language would belong. See requests 2007-245 and 2007-246.]

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Bhalay [bhx] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 as a separate language. However, Bhalay is a caste rather than an ethnic group with a particular language,
	and if they speak a language separate from their neighbours, it is Nimadi [noe] (**hh:e:RussellHiralal:Balahi**:106), which already has an E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 entry. See also: Nimadi [noe].

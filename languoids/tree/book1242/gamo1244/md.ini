comment = Seven years ago, Dawro was already considered to be separate from Gamo and Gofa.
	At that time, plans were made to begin a language development project in the
	Dawro language. In 2001, according to the Education Bureau of the Southern
	Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Regional State (SNNPR), both the Gamo-Gofa
	Zone and the Dawro Zone were developing their own education materials.
	Currently, Gamo and Gofa are also considered to be linguistically separate, each
	having their own language development project as of 2004.
	
	All of the Central Ometo speech varieties are quite similar, but there are some
	definite divisions along ethnic lines. For example, Wolaytta is a Central Ometo
	speech variety closely related to Gamo, Gofa and Dawro. However, these three
	have such a strong separate identity that they are not able to have a common
	body of literature with Wolaytta (this was established even before Dawro was
	split from the other two). The grouping of Gamo, Gofa and Dawro is now no longer
	possible due to political and identity reasons, and at least according to
	lexicostatistics there is no more cause for them to be grouped with each other
	than there is for them to be grouped with Wolaytta. In one study, the lexical
	similarity between these three was less than or equal to their similarity with
	Wolaytta (Girard 2002). See also the lexicostatistical data quoted in the
	Ethnologue (Gordon 2005).

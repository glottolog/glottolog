comment = We can find no evidence of the existence of this language in Yunnan Province,
	China, from Chinese and foreign linguistic sources. The Ethnologue editor has
	tracked the origins of this Ethnologue entry back to a 1953 thesis by linguist
	Dave Thomas. This work is apparently merely repeating a ethnonym cited by a
	non-linguist foreigner in 1949. The original work does not claim this to be a
	unique language. Therefore in the absence of any additional data, it appears
	best to remove this ISO code and consider this name to not refer to any unique
	language.

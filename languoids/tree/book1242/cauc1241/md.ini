[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Cauca [cca] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22 as an extinct Chocoan language of Colombia.
	No location is given but from the name it may be inferred it is supposed to have been spoken in the Cauca river valley. There is no attested language in the Cauca valley not already counted in other entries in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22 (**hh:hv:Loukotka:SAmerica**:246-249, 255-258) except Quimbaya which is attested in about 10 words. But there are doubts as to whether 8 of these two words are really attributable to the language of the Quimbaya ethnic group (**hh:hv:Adelaar:Andes**:57).
	In any case, there is too little data to assert that the Quimbaya spoke a language different from all its neighbours.

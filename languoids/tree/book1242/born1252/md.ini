[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Borna (Democratic Republic of Congo) [bxx], alternative name Eborna, is listed in E16/E17 as an Unclassified Southern Bantoid language of the DRC without a population estimate and without a location. The entry must emanate from **hh:h:Welmers:African**:786
	since that is the only source mentioning such a language with exactly that much (lack of) information. Welmers's list, in turn,
	derives from sheets of African languages at the US Office of Education started in 1959 (**hh:h:Welmers:African**:761). Since these sheets were hand-written there is considerable likelihood that Borna is a misreading of Boma or eBoma (the entry for which is Teke-Eboo [ebo]) which would have been extant in the literature at the appropriate time. See also: Teke-Eboo-Nzikou [ebo].

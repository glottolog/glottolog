comment = There is no evidence to support the existence of Talai as the name of a distinct
	language. Talai is the name of a region. In the Ethnologue 15th ed., Talai has
	been closely associated with Markweeta, née Endo: "'Marakwet' is a cover term
	for Talai and Endo." Thus it is appropriate to map any existing usage of the
	code element for Talai to Markweeta, which now refers to the whole language area
	and its dialects (whereas "Endo" referred only to the northern dialect area)

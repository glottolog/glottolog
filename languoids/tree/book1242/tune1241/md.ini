comment = Early linguistic survey of the area highlighted many distinguishing features of
	the Nyokon language (Richardson 1957:28-31). Lexicostatistical studies have
	shown that the linguistic similarity between the two speech varieties (Tunen and
	Nyokon) is so low that there is no possibility of inherent understanding. Mous
	and Breedveld show that the percentage of similar lexical items between the two
	languages is as low as 36% (1986:184). A previous study by Schadeberg and
	Voorhoeve gave a figure of approximately 50% (1977:24). Both studies show that
	Tunen is more closely related to Nomaande (Mandi) ([lem]) than to Nyokon. Field
	notes from D. Barreteau reveal that the class system of Nyokon does not align
	with Tunen, each containing classes and gender pairs that do not occur in the
	other. This data confirms the early (and still accepted) classification of
	Nyokon as a separate
	
	language labeled A.45 in Guthrie's system (1971, Maho 2003:641). Nyokon
	(ninyǤ'Ǥ) has also been given the language number code 514 in the Administrative
	Atlas of the National Languages of Cameroon (Breton and Fohtung 1991: 39). Mous,
	in his studies of Tunen, specifically presents Nyokon as a related language and
	not a dialect (2003:283). Guthrie
	
	and Tucker (1956:29) write, “Although NyǤ'̃ Ǥ̃ is closely related to Banǫn
	there can be no question of intercomprehension.”

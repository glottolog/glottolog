comment = The change I am proposing is that Ibilo [ibi] be changed from being a language
	within [Edo- Esan-Ora, North Central, Edoid, Benue-Congo, Volta-Congo,
	Atlantic-Congo, Niger-Congo], and be moved to being a dialect of Okpamheri
	[opa], located within the Northwestern Edoid branch.
	
	I have found no publication which places Ibilo within this subclassification.
	Nor have I found any dialect called "Ibilo" in these languages. In talking to
	Prof. Ron Schaefer (Southern Illinois University Edwardsville), who has
	extensive first hand experience with Emai and other Edoid languages, he knows of
	no languages or dialects called Ibilo in North Central. He also says that Ibillo
	is the principal village in the Okpamheri cluster, which include about 20 or so
	villages.
	
	Further, Ben Elugbe (University of Ibadan) has written extensively on
	comparitive Edoid.
	
	Elugbe (1989a: 24) cites that he used the Ibilo dialect of Okpamheri in his
	comparative work, and Elugbe (1989b: 296) notes that the Ibilo dialect is spoken
	in Ibilo town, and is a dialect of Okpamheri. He further provides in (1989b:
	296) the consonant inventory of Ibilo, showing it has breathy voiced consonants,
	and a lenis/nonlenis distinction. These are features of the Northwest branch.
	The Edo-Esan-Ora language group of North Central, within which Ibilo is
	classified by Ethnologue, do not contain these phonological features.
	
	Also, your map 6 of Nigeria (found at
	http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=NG&seq=80) shows that the code for
	Ibilo on the map is 305. This places it in the Northwest area of Edoid
	languages, not the North Central.
	
	Finally, in a non-linguistics article, Oseni (1991: 224) notes Okpamheri people
	from a town "Ibillo".
	
	These facts, I feel, warrant that its status as an independent language, with
	its own language code, be removed, unless there is some distinct evidence to
	classify it as a separate language from Okpamheri [opa].
	
	There is the possiblity that evidence and documentation exists that Ibilo is its
	own language within the North Central branch, or that perhaps it is some dialect
	of a North Central branch language, which happens to be homophonous with a
	dialect of Okpamheri in the Northwest branch. If this is the case, I would be
	very interested to see which sources this information comes from.

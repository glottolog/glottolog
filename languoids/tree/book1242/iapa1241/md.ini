[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Iapama [iap] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as an unclassified language in the Pará and Amapá border region of Brazil. It is located on the map but commented as ``existence uncertain''.  The location on the map, near the Jari river between Apalai [apy] and Wayampi [oym], can only match one known uncontacted group, i.e., number XXXIII of
	**hh:h:GrenandGrenand:Amerique**:111, ``Rio Ipitinga'' of
	**hh:hel:BrackelaireAzanha:Aislados**:322 as known as ``grupo arredio do alto Ipitinga'' of
	(**hh:he:GalloisRicardo:Amapa-Norte-Para**:102) or ``eine sehr isolierte Tupi-Gruppe an einem rechten Nebenflusse des Maecurú: die aussterbenden Ápama'' (**hh:hv:Frikel:Nord-Para**:515, 542). The little available evidence points to this group being an offshoot Wayampi [oym] group, though not impossibly an Apalai [apy] group. In either case, no separate language can be asserted, so the entry is spurious.

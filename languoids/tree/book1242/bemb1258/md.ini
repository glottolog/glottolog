[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Bemba [bmy] is listed in E16/E17 as an Unclassified Bantu language of South Kivu province in the DRC. A more precise location is not given. It is difficult to interpret this entry as anything other than a duplication of the Bembe [bmb] entry -- a relatively well-known Bantu language of the Lega complex in South Kivu province
	(**hh:h:vanBulck:Cartes-Congo-Belge**:48,
	**hh:h:Hulstaert:Congo-Belge**:31, **hh:h:Biebuyck:Lega**).
	The population of Bemba [bmy] is given as 296 000 which is a plausible figure if it refers to Bembe [bmb], and there is absolutely no sign of a different Bemba language of such a large population in Kivu province (**hh:h:Kadima:Zaire**:34-37,
	**hh:he:Moeller:Orientale-Congo**). The alternative name Kinyabemba for Bemba [bmy] suggests that the information on Bemba
	[bmy] came from transient Bembe in Rwanda and therefore the equality with Bembe [bmb] may have been overlooked. See also: Bembe [bmb].

comment = Upper Necaxa Totonac and Tecpatlán Totonac do not seem to be naively mutually
	intelligible, although many speakers of one have enough experience with the
	other that in practice they can communicate. However, Upper Necaxa as spoken in
	Patla, Chicontla, San Pedro Tlalontongo, and Cacahuatlán is distinguished by
	(and recognized as a dialect in the region according to) a number of sound
	changes including the neutralization of a contrast between the voiceless lateral
	affricate and the voiceless lateral fricative.Tecpatlán Totonac has also
	undergone a shift of /w/ to /b/ (a sound not found at all in Upper Necaxa).
	There are a great many lexical distinctions that set Tecpatlán apart from the
	others.
	
	Tecpatlán Totonac does, however, share one important sound change with the
	Upper Necaxa variety, the lenition of *q to a glottal stop and the concomittant
	collapse of historical fricative-q clusters to ejective fricatives. The shift is
	not quote complete in Tecpatlán, however, which retains /q/ in at least some
	lexical items. Tecpatlán and Upper Necaxa also share a shift in the grammatical
	paradigms so that many n-final verbs are treated as consonant-final stems for
	the purposes of perfective aspectual inflection (departing from the more common
	Totonacan pattern). These changes set Tecpatlán apart from Zihuateutla Totonac.

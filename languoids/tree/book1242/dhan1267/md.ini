comment = 1. The only language speaker count is the1961 Census . Later, in the 1991 Census
	has the Dhanwar speaking Marathi in Maharashtra, and Hindi in Madhya Pradesh
	[Chhattisgarh?]
	
	2. Lewisâ€™ (2009) estimate is the 1981 Census ethnic population. It is not the L1
	speaker population.
	
	3. The Joshua Project (2002) mentioned the Dhanwar speaker population but the
	latest version (Joshua Project 2009) reported that they speak Marathi.
	
	4. Singh (1993:87), Vaisanav (2004:6) reported that the Dhanwar speak
	Chhattisgarhi and Marathi. But with other groups they speak Chhattisgarhi, Hindi
	and Marathi. The other source mentioned that the Dhanwar people themselves
	reported that they speak Chhattisgarhi and Marathi (India in Focus 2004).
	
	5. From an informal interview with a person who works in Chhattisgarh, the
	Dhanwar speak Chhattisgarhi and Marathi as their first language.
	
	6. As early as 1916 when Russell (2006:488) was first published, the Dhanwar did
	not speak a language of their own, but rather spoke Chhattisgarhi and Hindi.

comment = Yos is the English plural form of the name 'Yo', which is just another
	pronunciation of 'Zo'. Yos/Yo is not a separate group or a separate language. It
	is the same as 'Zo'. No references to the 'Yos' exist apart from an obscure
	alleged reference in the 1983 Census of Myanmar. Yos [yos] should be retired
	from use, since it is equivalent to Zo [zom].

comment = E16/E17 has an entry Yos [yos], but this is just another name for Zou [zom]
	(**hh:hb:Matisoff:Tibeto-Burman**:118) and is thus spurious. See also: Zou
	[zom].

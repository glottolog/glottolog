comment = Apparently these two ISO codes were created as information on this language came
	from two different sources under two slightly different names, and it was not
	noticed that they were referring to the same variety. (The exact autonym [pə55kɑ̤n33]
	cannot be precisely phoneticized using Chinese characters or English spelling
	conventions.)

comment = 1. The original classification of Tingal as a separate language was based on a
	misreading of the only published reference to it.
	
	2. A field check has established that Tingal is a dialect of Tegali [ras].
	
	The Ethnologue entry for Tingal appears to be based solely on Tucker & Bryan,
	1956, p.70, "The speech of Tingal or Kajakja is reported to be different from
	that of Tegali and Rashad; it is uncertain whether it belongs to the Tegali or
	Tagoi Cluster. Population 520". This in turn would seem to be quoting almost
	directly from Stevenson, 1956/7, p.103, "The dialect of Tingal or Kajakja
	(Kajaja) (520 TP) is orally reported to be 'different from Tegali and Rashad'
	but it is uncertain whether it belongs to this cluster or to that of Tagoi."
	This does not establish Tingal as a language separate from Tegali [ras] and
	Tagoi [tag], and it was only based on hearsay.

comment = 1. The original classification of Tingal as a separate language was based on a
	misreading of the only published reference to it.
	
	2. A field check has established that Tingal is a dialect of Tegali [ras].
	
	The Ethnologue entry for Tingal appears to be based solely on Tucker & Bryan,
	1956, p.70, "The speech of Tingal or Kajakja is reported to be different from
	that of Tegali and Rashad; it is uncertain whether it belongs to the Tegali or
	Tagoi Cluster. Population 520". This in turn would seem to be quoting almost
	directly from Stevenson, 1956/7, p.103, "The dialect of Tingal or Kajakja
	(Kajaja) (520 TP) is orally reported to be 'different from Tegali and Rashad'
	but it is uncertain whether it belongs to this cluster or to that of Tagoi."
	This does not establish Tingal as a language separate from Tegali [ras] and
	Tagoi [tag], and it was only based on hearsay.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16 has Tingal [tie] as a separate language. This division stems from a
	conservative interpretation of
	**hh:hld:TuckerBryan:Non-Bantu-NEAfrica**:70's rendering of information provided
	by Stevenson. Stevenson had no first-hand data from Tingal and therefore could
	not assert that Tingal was a either a separate language or a dialect of Tegali
	or of Tagoi
	(**hh:hvs:Stevenson:Nuba**:103). When an early version of the Ethnologue was
	compiled, such cases were rendered as separate languages, and while some others,
	such as Tukum and Turum, were weeded out later, Tingal remained (p.c.~Andrew
	Persson 2009). In July 2009 in Kadugli, I was able to find a speaker who had
	grown up in Tingal and had excellent command of the language.  While I only had
	the opportunity to spend an hour or so with him, his speech was nearly identical
	to the Rashad and Tegali [ras] materials in
	**hh:hvs:Stevenson:Nuba**:46-52 and his own listing of villages whose speech was
	intelligible versus unintelligible to him matched the Tagoi/Tegali speaking
	villages listed by Stevenson perfectly.
	Based on this information, Tingal should be considered a Tegali dialect [ras].

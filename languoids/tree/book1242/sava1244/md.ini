[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The Savara [svr] entry listed as a Dravidian language of the Telugu group, separate from the well-known Munda Sora (also known as Savara) [srb] language. It has been checked quite carefully that there is no Dravidian language matching the name Savara or any of the other information in the entry (p.c.~David Stampe 2011), nor, for that matter, the Indo-Aryan Oriya variety labeled Sahara/Saora in **hh:hs:Mahapatra:Orissa**:183-184, but there is a plausible way in which the erroneous entry may have entered E16/E17/E18. **hh:hew:Dalton:Bengal** includes a Savara language which he (mistakenly) lists as a Dravidian language. The vocabulary included shows this Savara to be the Munda Sora [srb],
	not a different language. Presumably E16/E17/E18 is citing (some work that is still citing) Dalton's listing of Savara as a Dravidian language. I wish to thank David Stampe and John Peterson for discussing this entry with me. See also: Sora [srb].

[iso_retirement]
comment = Sarasira and Sukurum were formerly listed as dialects of Adzera. However, even
	though they are closer geographically to Adzera villages, historically and
	linguistically they are more closely related to the Mari and Wampur languages,
	and are thus in a different subfamily of the Upper Markham language family to
	Adzera. Susanne Holzknecht has documented the linguistic differences in:
	Holzknecht, Susanne. 1989. The Markham Languages of Papua New Guinea. Pacific
	Linguistics C-115. Canberra: Australian National University. Her work provides
	sufficient proof that these speech varieties are indeed separate languages that
	belong in the Mountain subgroup of Upper Markham languages, rather than being
	included as dialects of Adzera. Malcolm Ross also treats these three languages
	as distinct languages of the Upper Markham subfamily in his 1986 Ph.D.
	dissertation, later published as: Ross, Malcolm D. 1988. Proto Oceanic and the
	Austronesian languages of Western Melanesia. Pacific Linguistics C-98. Canberra:
	Australian National University.

comment = The Ditidaht Band is recognized by the Canadian government as a Band of the
	Nuu-chah- nulth Tribe, while the Pacheedaht are recognized as an independent
	First Nation. The Ditidaht language is recognized as an individual language by
	the First Peoples' Heritage, Language and Culture Council, which is a Crown
	Corporation, and appointed by the government of Bristish Columbia to oversee
	provincial funding for native language revitalization.
	
	The name 'Ditidaht' is commonly used for the traditional language that is shared
	by the present-day Ditidaht and Pacheedaht, though only the Ditidaht also use
	the name as an ethnonym. The Ditidaht and Pacheedaht peoples have distinct
	ethnic identities from each other, as well as distinct ethnolinguistic
	identities from their most closely related neighbours, the Nuu-chah-nulth of
	Vancouver Island, and the Makah of the Olympic Peninsula.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 has an entry Kannada Kurumba [kfi] which is not mapped but its name, alternative names, region and comments indicate it is meant to subsume Kurumba groups who speak varieties close to Kannada, e.g., Alu, Jennu, and Betta Kurumba as well as Palu Kurumba who speak a variety closer to Tamil
	(**hh:hvlde:Zvelebil:Nilagiri**, **hh:hlde:Menon:Dravidian**).  All of these Kurumba varieties already have entries in Alu Kurumba [xua], Jennu Kurumba [xuj], Betta Kurumba [xub], and Palu Kurumba = Attapaddy Kurumba [pkr]. The large number of speakers indicated, as well as the name, is consistent with the entry referring to the large community of shepherds in Tamil Nadu
	(**hh:he:Aiyappan:Aboriginal-Madras**:125-128) also called Kurumba. However, their language is a dialect of Kannada and thus covered in the Kannada [kan] entry (**hh:s:Varma:Kurumba-Kannada**). See also: Kannada [kan].

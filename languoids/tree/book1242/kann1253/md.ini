[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19 has an entry Kannada Kurumba [kfi] which is not mapped but its
	name, alternative names, region and comments indicate it is meant to subsume
	Kurumba groups who speak varieties close to Kannada, e.g., Alu, Jennu, and Betta
	Kurumba as well as Palu Kurumba who speak a variety closer to Tamil
	(**hh:hvlde:Zvelebil:Nilagiri**, **hh:hlde:Menon:Dravidian**).  All of these
	Kurumba varieties already have entries in Alu Kurumba [xua], Jennu Kurumba
	[xuj], Betta Kurumba [xub], and Palu Kurumba = Attapaddy Kurumba [pkr]. The
	large number of speakers indicated, as well as the name, is consistent with the
	entry referring to the large community of shepherds in Tamil Nadu
	(**hh:he:Aiyappan:Aboriginal-Madras**:125-128) also called Kurumba. However,
	their language is a dialect of Kannada and thus covered in the Kannada [kan]
	entry (**hh:s:Varma:Kurumba-Kannada**). See also: Kannada [kan].

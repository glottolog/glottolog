[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 lists Southern Lolopo [ysp] as a separate Central Yi language in the Jingdong, Jinggu, Lancang, Zhenyuan,
	Simao and Pu'er counties of Yunnan province, China. The (rather vague) location and classification matches the locations (and classification) described for Lolopo [ycl] and Miqie [yiq] in other sources (**hh:hb:Matisoff:Tibeto-Burman**, **hh:hel:Bradley:EAsia**,
	**hh:hv:Bradley:Tibeto-Burman**:104) and the Southern Lolopo
	[ysp] entry is quite possibly a confusion. See also: Lolopo [ycl], Miqie [yiq].

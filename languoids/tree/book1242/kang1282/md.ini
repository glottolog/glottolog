[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Kang [kyp], alternative name Tai Khang, is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a
	Tai-Kadai language of Laos in the region bordering China but is not shown own
	the Laos map. The exhaustive survey of Tai peoples of Laos by
	**hh:he:Schliesinger:Austro-Thai** finds no Tai-Kadai language matching this
	name and location. The Tai-Kadai languages matching the vaguely specified
	location are already counted in other entries in E16/E17/E18/E19 and the Tay
	Khang [tnu] language is spoken much too far south
	(in Bolikhamsai) and by a much smaller population
	(**hh:he:Schliesinger:Austro-Thai**). Kang [kyp] is said to have have
	47 600 speakers in Laos and thus could hardly have escaped survey. The entry is
	presumably a confusion of an existing language and the Tai-Kadai Tay Khang [tnu]
	language. See also: Tay Khang [tnu].

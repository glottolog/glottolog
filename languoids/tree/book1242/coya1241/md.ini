[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18 has three entries describing extinct Unclassified Colombian
	languages in the Tolima region: Coyaima
	[coy], Natagaimas [nts] and Pijao [pij].  These names are known in the
	literature, but Natagaimas and Coyaima are villages where Pijao was spoken in
	its final stages (**hh:vld:DurbinSeijas:Pijao**) so the three the entries should
	therefore be merged into one. This language is attested with a published
	minuscule wordlist. See also: Natagaimas [nts], Pijao [pij].

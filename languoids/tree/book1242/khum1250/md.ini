comment = The 1931 Census of Burma report contains an appendix about the “Awa Khami”,
	“Ahraing Khami”, and “Mro”. Clan lists as well as some vocabulary items are
	included and make it easier to identify which groups were being referred to.
	
	The Awa Khami and Ahraing Khami vocabulary items from the 1931 Census are very
	similar to each other and match with wordlists collected from the group today
	known as Mro-Khimi.
	
	The Mro-Khimi today recognize two broad sub-groupings, Wakung (“downstream”) and
	Areung (“upstream”). The speech variety spoken by the vast majority of people is
	known as Wakung. ‘Wa’ is a Rakhine/Burmese word meaning “mouth of a stream”.
	‘Kung’ is a Mro-Khimi word also meaning “mouth of a stream’. This “Awa Khami”
	clan lists from the 1931 Census match with the current Wakung clans, making
	identification clear.
	
	The Areung sub-group includes multiple speech varieties, including Hrengna and
	Xata. This sub- group matches with the Ahraing Khami in the 1931 Census.
	
	The Wakung and Areung groups consider themselves to belong to one common overall
	group, Mro- Khimi, and speak similar speech varieties. Thus, they are grouped
	together here under one ISO entry.
	
	Regarding the name for the group, there is currently some disagreement. While
	most of the group uses the name Mro-Khimi, those living in Buthidaung Township
	use the name Khimi. The majority group has chosen to include Mro in their name
	to distinguish themselves from the Khumi, who live in Paletwa Township, Chin
	State. However, the group living in Buthidaung Township does not have contact
	with the Khumi. Instead, they distinguish themselves from the Mru who live
	nearby by not including “Mro” in their name. Both groups agree, however, that
	they do not want to be called “Chin”.
	
	For the ISO entry, we have chosen to use the name chosen by the majority with a
	note about the situation in Buthidaung Township.
	
	In the 1931 Census, the vocabulary lists of "Mro" match with wordlists from the
	group today known as Mru (mro), not Mro-Khimi. This group lives in Bangladesh
	and Myanmar and speaks a very divergent speech variety from the Mro-Khimi. They
	are known by a variety of other names including Mrung, Mrusa, Dak, Launghu, and
	Taung “mountain” Mru.
	
	Mru (mro) is already represented by a distinct ISO entry, and the current Mro
	(cmr) entry has up until now been used to refer to the Mro-Khimi. Thus, for
	clarity, it would be better to merge the Chin, Khumi Awa (cka) and Chin, Mro
	(cmr) entries and change the name to Mro-Khimi.

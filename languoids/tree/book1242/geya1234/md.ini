[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Gey [guv] (Gewe, Gueve) is listed in E16/E17/E18 as a separate Adamawa language in Cameroon. But this language is attested with numerals in
	**hh:hw:Baudelaire:Numeration** which shows it to be the same language as Duli [duz], attested in **hh:hw:Baudelaire:Numeration**
	and **hh:hw:Strumpell:Mandara-Adamaua**.  So the Gey [guv] entry duplicates Duli [duz]. A curiousity is that the numerals of this Duli-Gey language resemble numerals of the Bata group of Chadic while the rest of the vocabulary shows good resemblances to the Leko-Nimbari subgroup of Adamawa. I wish to thank Roger Blench and Richard Gravina for discussion of this vocabulary.

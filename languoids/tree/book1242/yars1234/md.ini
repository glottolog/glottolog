[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Yarsun [yrs], a Sarmi coast Oceanic language, was not found on survey 2005 (according to E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24 itself) and its presumed existence seems to stem from the Index of Irian Jaya languages
	(**hh:h:SilzerClouse:Index**). The first mention of it is as an island (not singled out as a separate language) between Anus and Podena is by **hh:h:vanderLeeden:Sarmische** who considers Anus
	[auq], Podena [pdn] and Yarsun [yrs] one and the same language.
	Thus the Yarsun [yrs] entry is either the same as Anus [auq] or Podena [pdn] or unattested. See also: Anus [auq], Podena [pdn].

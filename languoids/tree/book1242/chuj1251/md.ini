comment = The name is a dialect or dialect group name, and therefore incorrect for a
	language designation. It should be changed to the general language name. There
	is almost no disagreement among linguists about what the general language names
	for Mayan languages are. The majority of the Ethnologue/ISO names are, however,
	dialect names. Please see section 4 for an elaboration of the languages
	according to family divisions and branches.

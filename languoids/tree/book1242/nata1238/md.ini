[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18 has three entries describing extinct Unclassified Colombian languages in the Tolima region: Natagaimas [nts], Pijao
	[pij] and Coyaima [coy].  These names are known in the literature, but Natagaimas and Coyaima are villages where Pijao was spoken in its final stages (**hh:vld:DurbinSeijas:Pijao**) so the three the entries should therefore be merged into one. This language is attested with a published minuscule wordlist. See also: Coyaima [coy], Pijao [pij].

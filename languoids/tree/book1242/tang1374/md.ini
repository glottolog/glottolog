comment = Lexical similiarity of Dari and Tangshewi is between 86% and 90%. Comprehension
	testing of Eastern Farsi (Dari) showed that Dari is highly intelligible for the
	Tangshewi people. The Tangshewi call the valley they live in Tangshew valley but
	not their speech variety. No one ever mentioned a language called Tangshewi as
	his mother tongue. The Tangshewi themselves explain that they speak Dari,
	acknowledging that their dialect is slightly different.

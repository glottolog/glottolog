[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Pao [ppa] is listed in E16/E17/E18 as a Tibeto-Burman language of the scheduled
	tribe Pao of Madhya Pradesh in India. However, the Pao speak a variety of
	Bundelkhandi to themselves and others
	(**hh:he:Singh:Scheduled**:977-979,
	**hh:hb:Shukla:Madhya-Pradesh**,
	**hh:h:Singh:Scheduled**:63), a language which already has an E16/E17/E18 entry
	in Bundeli [bns]. The misclassification of Pao as a Tibeto-Burman languages in
	E16/E17/E18 presumably results from confusion of Pao in Madhya Pradesh with the
	Tibeto-Burman language Pa'o (of the Karenic subgroup) in Myanmar, also rendered
	as Pao
	(**hh:phon:Nishida:Pao**). See also: Bundeli [bns].

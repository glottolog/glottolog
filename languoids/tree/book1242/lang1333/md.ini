comment = lists Lang'e [yne] as a separate language of Yongsheng county in Yunnan
	province, but this language is intelligible with Talu [yta]
	(**hh:hvw:Lama:Nisoic**:80) which already has a separate entry. There is
	possibly confusion with the Chinese variety of Lhao Vo [mhx] which is also
	called Lang'e and also in Yunnan province,
	but spoken closer to the border with Myanmar
	(**hh:hld:Dai:Jingpo**, **hh:hv:Mann:NBurmic**), in which case the entry is also
	spurious, duplicating Lhao Vo [mhx]. See also: Maru [mhx], Lavu-Yongsheng-Talu
	[yta].

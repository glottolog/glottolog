[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = lists Lang'e [yne] as a separate language of Yongsheng county in Yunnan province, but this language is intelligible with Talu [yta] (**hh:hvw:Lama:Nisoic**:80) which already has a separate entry. There is possibly confusion with the Chinese variety of Lhao Vo [mhx] which is also called Lang'e and also in Yunnan province,
	but spoken closer to the border with Myanmar
	(**hh:hld:Dai:Jingpo**, **hh:hv:Mann:NBurmic**), in which case the entry is also spurious, duplicating Lhao Vo [mhx]. See also: Lavu-Yongsheng-Talu [yta], Maru [mhx].

comment = Panang” (Tibetan sbra.nag ‘black tent’) is the name of a particular subgroup of
	Amdo Tibetans.
	
	Denwood (1999:30) identifies their language as belonging to the category of
	“Amdo dialects with oral [onset consonant] clusters only”. My own examination of
	the data in Kara (1984) leads me to the same conclusion: this is nothing more
	than a variety of Amdo Tibetan. Varieties of Amdo Tibetan have a high degree of
	mutual intelligibility; Sung and
	
	lHa.byams rGyal (2005: xviii) give a typical report: “[T]he sub-dialects within
	the Amdo region display remarkable uniformity. Any two people from different
	places inside the Amdo region can usually communicate with little or no
	difficulty.”
	
	There is therefore no reason for “Panang” to have its own ISO-693-3 code.

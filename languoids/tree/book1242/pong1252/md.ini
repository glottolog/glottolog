comment = In short, the rationale for this proposed change is that no proper evidence has
	ever been presented for Pongyong's [pgy] existence as a unique language. As far
	as Nepali linguists can tell, this is a "ghost entry" in the ISO 639-3.
	“Pongyong” is a Rai clan name (Van Driem 2001:623). It is unlikely to be a
	separate language from Saam [raq]. The existence of Pongyong as a unique
	language was originally based on a single questionnaire by the German survey
	published by Hansson (1988:20-21; 1991:76-77, 84-85), which is known for having
	sometimes made big claims based on almost no data (such as is the case with
	Pongyong). Due to such scanty data, Hansson himself hedged to say that Pongyong
	may be a part of Saam [raq] (Hansson 1988:20-21; Hansson 1991:61, 85). I have
	not yet found any Kirati language scholars that have heard of Pongyong suggested
	as a unique language (outside of Hansson's work) or of Pongyong claimed by
	anyone as their own language. There is also little documentation (albeit some)
	about Saam, so there does not seem to be enough evidence to merge these ISO code
	elements. It seems that the Pongyong code element should be eliminated from ISO
	639-3 or at grouped together as a part of Saam [raq] if for some reason that is
	necessary. I think eliminating the [pgy] code element makes the most sense.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Four entries in E16/E17/E18 are described as extinct Arawakan, Unclassified languages of Colombia with no more precise location given: Cumeral
	[cum], Omejes [ome], Ponares [pod], Tomedes [toe].  They are not to be found in anywhere else in the literature (except a few recent publications which are derivative of earlier Ethnologue versions),
	including otherwise exhaustive literature on past languages of Colombia
	(**hh:hvw:Ortiz:Colombia**, **hh:hv:Loukotka:SAmerica**, **hh:hv:Landaburu:Colombia**).
	Even if one were to find referent populations for these names, the entries should be removed on the grounds of insufficient information to decide if it is the same as an otherwise existing entry. See also: Omejes [ome], Ponares [pod], Tomedes [toe].

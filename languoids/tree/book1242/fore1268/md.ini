[iso_retirement]
comment = Forest Maninka is a phantom language. I’m afraid, I’m partly guilty of its
	emergence: many years ago, I invented this term as generic for the continuum
	Manya – Konya – Odienne Jula, and later on, someone reinterpreted it as a
	language of a lower level. In reality, no language of this name exists.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The Forest Maninka (also known as Wassulunka) [myq] entry in E16/E17 is
	described as an ethnic Fulani group who now speak an East Manding language. This
	variety, however, scores over 90% lexicostatistical similarity with several
	other East Manding (e.g., Eastern Maninkakan [emk]) languages which have
	separate entries in the E16/E17 (**hh:hvw:Long:NMande**:56) and should thus not
	have a separate entry. See also: Eastern Maninkakan [emk].

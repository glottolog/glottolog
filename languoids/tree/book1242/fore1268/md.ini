comment = Forest Maninka is a phantom language. I’m afraid, I’m partly guilty of its
	emergence: many years ago, I invented this term as generic for the continuum
	Manya – Konya – Odienne Jula, and later on, someone reinterpreted it as a
	language of a lower level. In reality, no language of this name exists.

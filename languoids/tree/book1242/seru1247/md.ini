[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25 lists Seru [szd] as an extinct separate Sarawak-Melanau-Kajang language. However, it has been known for a century that the Sru were a fraction of the Ukit [umi] who happened to end up at Sru, and indeed, ``every word ...'' in the wordlist of **hh:ew:Bailey:Seru** were understood by the Ukit [umi]
	``as belonging to their own language'' (**hh:e:DeRozario:Sru**:332). See also: Ukit [umi].

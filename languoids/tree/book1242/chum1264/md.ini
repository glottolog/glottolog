comment = Chumash is actually a family name, not a language name. Language family members
	are Barbareño [boi], Cruzeño [crz], Ineseño [inz], Obispeño [obi],
	Purisimeño [puy], and Ventureño [veo].
	
	
	In the 13th edition of Ethnologue and in older linguistic literature on Native
	America "Chumash" was listed by itself as a single language. Since the middle of
	the 20th century, however, it has been recognized that Chumash was a family of
	six mutually unintelligible languages. In the 14th edition of Ethnologue, the
	six constituent languages were added, but the entry "Chumash" was not deleted,
	resulting in the retention of "Chumash" as a constituent of itself. All
	specialist literature on the languages of California list 6 languages as
	constituents of the Chumash language family.

comment = E16 has an entry Chumash [chs] with information that could match several
	individual Chumashan languages. E16 also has entries for the individual
	Chumashan languages Obispeño [obi], Cruzeño [crz], Ventureño [veo], Purisimeño
	[puy], Ineseño [inz] and Barbareño [boi], which exhaust the attested Chumashan
	languges (**hh:hvb:Golla:California**). This leaves the Chumash [chs]-entry
	spurious. See also: Barbareño [boi], Purisimeño [puy], Ineseño [inz], Obispeño
	[obi], Cruzeño [crz], Ventureño [veo].

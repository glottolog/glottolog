[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17 lists Buya [byy] as an Unclassified Southern Bantoid language of the DRC
	without a location. This must emanate from **hh:h:Welmers:African**:788-789
	since that is the only source mentioning such a language with exactly that much
	(lack of)
	information. In all likelihood, Buya [byy] is a rendering of a DRC language
	already counted in another E16/E17 entry, presumbly Buyu
	[byi]. See also: Buyu [byi].

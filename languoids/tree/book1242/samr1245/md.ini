[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24 lists a (now extinct) language called Samre [sxm]. The information in the entry can only match the Samre of Siem Reap attested by a wordlist
	(see **hh:w:Headley:Pearic**). But this variety is very closely related to Somray of Battambang in the Somray [smu] entry, and must have been intelligible to it (**hh:hvw:Headley:Proto-Pearic**, **hh:hv:Sidwell:Austroasiatic**:134-139). See also: Somray of Battambang-Somre of Siem Reap [smu].

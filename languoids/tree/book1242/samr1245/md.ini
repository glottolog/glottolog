[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 lists a (now extinct) language called Samre [sxm]. The information in the entry can only match the Samre of Siem Reap attested by a wordlist
	(see **hh:w:Headley:Pearic**). But this variety is very closely related to Somray of Battambang in the Somray [smu] entry, and must have been intelligible to it (**hh:hvw:Headley:Proto-Pearic**, **hh:hv:Sidwell:Austroasiatic**:134-139). See also: Somray of Battambang-Somre of Siem Reap [smu].

comment = Samre (1223-sxm) = Critically Endangered (100 percent certain, based on the evidence available) ("There are only 20-30 Samre speakers left at present. All of them are over 55 years old. The older Samre people generally speak Thai and they use the Samre language only among their group. The middle-aged and younger members refuse to speak their mother tongue because their ethnic language has no script. This leads to the prediction that this ethnic language in Thailand will be lost in about twenty years." (p.171)) [Pornsawan 2005](elcat:bd4dec2232feaeecd44bb5e5ad87dd77)

comment = Since Voeglin & Voeglin 1977 was written, there have been two major surveys done
	of the area of Seram where the Elpaputih language supposedly exists. Collins
	conducted his survey from 1977 to 1979 and published his results 1982 in Oceanic
	Linguistics. Taguchi and other SIL linguists conducted survey in the same
	general area from 1985-1988 and published their results in Workpapers in
	Indonesian Languages and Cultures in 1989. Neither of the surveys report any
	language by the name of Elpaputih. There are two languages on the Elpaputih Bay
	which may have been included in the Elpaputih language amq (Amahai), plh
	(Paulohi). These two languages are now nearly extinct. It seems probable that
	the lack of information caused Voeglin & Voeglin to erroneously suggest that
	Elpaputih was it's own language. I would suggest that with the new information
	from Collins and Taguchi, the Elpaputih language be removed from the Ethnologue.

comment = Souletin is just a dialect of Basque, and so is asserted by all speakers from
	the Soule region from the first written records in 17th century to the present.
	Nobody identifies his or her language as "Souletin". All their putative speakers
	uniformly self-identify as Basque speakers. From 1964 there is a standard Basque
	("euskara batua" or unified Basque), which is the language taught in most
	schools, including those in the French Basque Country, and used in the media and
	official documents of the Basque Country.

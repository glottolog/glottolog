comment = There are clear distinctions in the sociolinguistic identies of the two
	linguistic communities which parallel the larger sociological and cultural
	distinctions between the Flanders (northern) and Walloon (sourthern) regions of
	Belgium. The actual linguistic differences are apparently less clear, yet the
	trend within the Deaf communities in these two regions is clearly toward
	establishing separate linguistic identities for the signed languages of the
	northern and southern parts of Belgium. For example:
	
	"In the past the term Belgian Sign Language was commonly used, because one
	believed there were more resemblances between the two sign languages used in
	Flanders and Wallonia than between those used in Flanders and the Netherlands.
	Also, the first sign language research in Belgium was carried out by Flemish and
	Walloon researchers together. In their publications they always mentioned
	Belgian Sign Language. Deaf people themselves spoke of signs or sign language
	without really specifying which one. A few years ago, the name changed. Because
	of the lack of sufficient linguistic evidence that would enable us to speak of
	two completely different sign languages, the compromise Flemish Belgian Sign
	Language was chosen to refer to the variant used in Flanders. However, because
	of the split of NAVEKADOS (the former Belgian Deaf Association) into a Flemish
	and a Walloon organization, reduced contact between the Flemish and Walloon Deaf
	and the different processes of standardization, Deaf people got more and more
	dissatisfied with the term Flemish Belgian and wanted to change it into Flemish.
	FEVLADO [the Flemish Deaf association, http://www.fevlado.be/] also advocated
	this change at an Annual General Meeting in October 2000. This is why from that
	moment on the term Flemish Sign Language is used in all publications concerning
	the Flemish Deaf community and their mother tongue."

	"In short, up until about fifteen years ago, people were usually signing,
	talking, and writing about Belgian Sign Language. Now, many Deaf people feel
	intuitively that the signed language used in Flanders is very different from the
	one used in the Netherlands (even though the two hearing communities speak the
	same language, Dutch) but that it is closer to the signed language used in
	Wallonia (although the Walloon hearing community speaks French). Right now, not
	enough linguistic evidence has been collected to know whether the differences
	between Flanders and Wallonia are big enough to allow talk about two different
	signed languages. Hence, as a good Belgian compromise, the term Flemish Belgian
	Sign Language was used in recent years for the signed language variants used in
	Flanders. However, because of the split of the national Deaf federation into two
	regional federations, the fewer and fewer contacts among both organizations and
	their members, and the separate standardization processes, most Deaf people in
	Flanders prefer to talk about Flemish Sign Language. This term is also the term
	that was adopted by Fevlado at its last annual general meeting (AGM) in October
	2000. At that AGM, the participants were asked to vote for either the term
	Flemish Sign Language or the term Flemish Belgian Sign Language. The first
	option was nearly unanimously elected. Even though this choice is obviously more
	politically than linguistically motivated, I want to respect the opinion of the
	Flemish Deaf Association and its members and will talk about Flemish Sign
	Language from now on... [Mieke Van Herreweghe, 2002. "Turn-Taking Mechanisms and
	Active Participation in Meetings with Deaf and Hearing Participants in
	Flanders", in Turn-Taking, Fingerspelling, and Contact in Signed Languages, Ceil
	Lucas, ed., available online at
	http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/TTFCthree3.html]
	
	Regarding the situation in French-speaking Belgium (Wallonia and the major parts
	of Brussels), in the early 1980s, the term "Langue Française Signée" (Signed
	French Language) was used, then it changed into "Langue des Signes Belge"
	(Belgian Sign Language) or "Langue des Signes Française de Belgique" (French
	Sign Language of Belgium). However, Deaf people have become quite unsatisfied
	with these terms and thus, another term was advocated. Since then, Langue des
	Signes Belge Francophone or Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone has been
	used during formal meetings although most deaf people still refer their language
	as "sign language". There was never a compromise on which term to use.
	Therefore, sign language researchers hired to write a report on the feasibility
	of an official recognition of the sign language used in French-speaking Belgium
	chose the term "Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone" and an abbreviation
	which reflected the close relationship between this sign language and French
	Sign Language : LSFB.
	
	According to Dr. Vermeerbergen, comprehension of LSFB by signers of VGT varies
	according to the person, the region from which the two signers are from, and the
	topic of conversation. For example, older Deaf from Flanders understand LSFB
	better than younger Deaf, who have had less contact with signers from Walloonia.
	This suggests that the comprehension is based on learned bidialectalism rather
	than inherent intelligibility. Those from central areas in Flanders understand
	LSBF better than those from peripheral areas, which is indication that the sign
	language situation in Belgium is in some respects a dialect chain which the Deaf
	communities in both regions have decided to break into two separate languages
	along political lines.
	
	The Parliament of French-speaking Belgium recognised LSFB in a decree of October
	2003, which acknowledges the existing internal variation and advocates allowing
	it to develop toward standardization along its own natural evolutionary path.
	The decree is available at
	http://www.fevlado.be/themas/gebarentaal/documenten/Decreet%20FBelg%20Gebarentaal.pdf.
	Official recognition of VGT by the government in Flanders was granted in April
	2006 (http://www.fevlado.be/nieuws/nieuwsDetail.aspx?item=150). The proposed
	text of the decree is available at

	The name Kabixi (with variant spellings) has been applied to a range of different ethnic groups (see **hh:e:Price:Cabixi:1983** for a superb historical treatment), including Parecís (Arawakan), Huanyam
	(Chapacuran) and Southern Nambiquara (Nambiquaran) speakers. The location in the entry can be read to match either the Southern Nambiquara and Sararé of **hh:hv:Price:Nambiquara:1985**, both of which correspond to another E16/E17/E18 entry, i.e., Southern Nambikuára [nab]. The classification in the entry points to it being Huanyam (**hh:hew:Nordenskiold:Forskningar**), which would explain why Huanyam is otherwise missing from E16/E17/E18. The location matches Southern Nambiquara better but is reconcilable with Huanyam. However,
	a population of 100 in 1986 is too much if it refers to Huanyam which would have been down to a few families or less in the 1980s
	(**hh:e:Becker-Donner:Huanyam**, **hh:w:Hanke:Huanyam**). A population of 100
	is difficult to match with 20 Sararé and 350 Southern Nambiquara
	(**hh:hv:Price:Nambiquara:1985**) as well, so possibly 1986 should be read as the date of the information passing to the Ethnologue rather than the date of the observation. The claim that Kabixi [xbx] is related to Maxakali [mbl] cannot be reconciled with either Southern Nambiquara or Huanyam and can only make sense if the entry refers to Rikbaktsa [rkb] (**hh:e:Dornstauder:Juruena**) or Beiços-de-Pau, now integrated with the Suyá [suy] (**hh:ew:Vicente:Beicos-de-Pau**), but these peoples live too far north of the area where the name Kabixi used to be applied. Since the information in the entry either duplicates other entries or has misleading information (at least the assertion that the entry does not represent Parecis [pab], perhaps the language most frequently called Kabixi, is not misleading.), it should be dropped or corrected to form a more accurate Huanyam entry. See also: Maxakalí [mbl], Parecís [pab], Rikbaktsa [rkb], Southern Nambikuára [nab], Suyá [suy].

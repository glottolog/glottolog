comment = The original criteria for including Horuru in the ethnologue as a separate
	language seem to be outweighed by the data that suggests that the name is Haruru
	and is simply a dialect of Yalahatan. Since the only reference for Horuru is
	Voegelin 1965 which is somewhat of a survey of several languages and the only
	note about Horuru is that it may be an alternate for another languoage or
	extinct, the original inclusion of Horuru seems to be a little weak. Yalahatan,
	which is spoken in only two villages (Yalahatan and Haruru), matches well with
	the classification of Horuru, both being in the Three Rivers linguistic
	grouping. The geographic location of Horuru is simply Central Maluku, Seram
	which is home to several languages, one of which isYalahatan. Since there's no
	language polygon, the location could be anywhere on the island of Seram, but
	nowhere else in Seram is there a village by the name Horuru or a tribe that goes
	by that name (based on the government statistic data from 2000). The closest to
	the name Horuru is the village Haruru which speaks a dialect of the Yalahatan
	language (Sakiyama 1999 and Beckley personal communication).

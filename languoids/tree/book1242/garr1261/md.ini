comment = Garreh-Ajuran is not a specific language, but rather a pair of closely allied
	ethnic groups. The Garreh people speak Borana as a first language and Somali as
	a second language while the Ajuran people are divided into two groups; those who
	speak Borana as a first language and those who speak Somali as a first language.

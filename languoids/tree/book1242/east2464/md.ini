[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Eastern Ngad'a [nea] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as a separate language from
	Ngad'a [nxg] but no such language can be verified from the literature on Ngada
	(**hh:s:Arndt:Ngada**, **hh:st:Djawanai:Ngadha**, **hh:phon:Moore:Ngada**) and
	Leif Asplund who did field research in the area (p.c. Leif Asplund 2015) was
	told the language of the Eastern Ngad'a area was completely intelligible to
	Ngad'a.
	See also: Ngad'a [nxg].

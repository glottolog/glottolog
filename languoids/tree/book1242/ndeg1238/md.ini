[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = The field trip of
	**hh:h:Blench:Little-Known-Nigerian** attempted to reach Antere near the Nigeria-Cameroon border but only succeeded in interviewing people from Antere in Yerimaru. They were told of a Ndɛgbítɛ language spoken by the Bĩtĩ people and from this information the separate language entry Nde-Gbite [ned]. However,
	no data for Nde-Gbite was ever recorded and no specific village village location (or quarter location in Andere) is given. Since the language is unattested and not specifically located, it cannot be asserted to be different from all other languages.

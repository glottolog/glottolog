[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17/E18 lists four entries for variaties of the dialect complex also known as Lua'/Mal/T'in/Pray (on the Border of Thailand and Laos) classified as follows:
	
	
	| Mal-Phrai (3) |  |
	|  | Lua'    [prb] |
	|  | Mal     [mlf] |
	|  | Pray 3  [pry] |
	| Mal-Prai (1) |  |
	|  | Prai  [prt] |
	
	
	They are given overlapping names, speaker numbers, classification and locations on map, in a way that cannot be reconciled with detailed surveys of the Mal-Prai area (**hh:hv:Filbeck:Tin**, **hh:socdial:DillerDiller:Prai**, **hh:hv:Rischel:Mlabri-Mon-Khmer**). We suggest removing Pray 3 [pry], which is the entry whose location is the least well-defined and whose existence it least motivated by detailed surveys (**hh:hv:Filbeck:Tin**, **hh:socdial:DillerDiller:Prai**, **hh:hv:Rischel:Mlabri-Mon-Khmer**).
	 See also: Lua' [prb], Mal [mlf], Prai [prt].

comment = 1.) Linguistic/Ethnic Identity: The ethnic and linguistic identity of people in both groups (Yamphe [yma] and Southern Lorung [lrr]) is 'Yamphu.'
	2.) Attitudes: The varieties spoken in these areas, currently denoted at Yamphe [yma] and Southern Lorung [lrr], consider themselves similar to each other and linguistically different from Yamphu [ybi].
	3.) Wordlist data: Initial lexical similarity percentages for wordlists among the Yamphe [yma] Southern Lorung [lrr] varieties range between 83% and 86% similarity.
	4.) Terms of reference: Neither speakers nor scholars like or use the terms 'Yamphe' or 'Southern Lorung'. These terms were taken Hansson (1991), which is considered by most scholars to have made dubious choices for terms of reference in this region.
	5.) Linguistic evidence: Both Yamphe [yma] and Southern Lorung [lrr] are linguistically distinct from Yamphu [ybi]. The initial lexical similarity between Yamphe [yma] and Yamphu [ybi] is 67% and between Southern Lorung [lrr] and Yamphu [ybi] is 64%. Intelligibility testing (Recorded Text Tests) was conducted between Southern Lorung [lrr] and Yamphu [ybi] as well as between Yamphe [yma] and Yamphu [ybi]. The average score among Southern Lorung speakers on the Yamphu [ybi] story was 43% with a standard deviation of 14. The average score among Yamphe [yma] speakers on the Yamphu [ybi] story was 58% with a standard deviation of 21.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16 has a separate entry Yamphe [yma] which appears to be a leftover of varieties taken up in the linguistic survey of Nepal (**hh:hv:Hansson:Rai**). However, Sibao Yamphe of **hh:hv:Hansson:Rai** falls under Southern Lorung, i.e., the Southern Yamphu [lrr] entry, and other varieties that may be called Yamphe fall under the Yamphu [ybi] entry (**hh:hwsoc:HiltyMitchell:Yamphu**, **hh:g:Rutgers:Yamphu**). See also: Yamphu [ybi], Southern Yamphu [lrr].

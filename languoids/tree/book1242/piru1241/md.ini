comment = In the previous cycle, the languages Piru and Luhu were combined, as the Piru
	group were determined to be a dialect of Luhu. The forms were written so that
	the code and name retained were [ppr] Piru. The name for this combined group
	should be Luhu.
	
	The old information is most likely based on Taguchi's lexicostatistic data.
	However, Collins has done more in depth research in the area and has published a
	few articles that show
	
	the similirities. The following are some excerpts from the published sources in
	the sources section of this request: “At the head of Piru Bay, a very small
	number of elderly in Piru village still remember the indigenous language.
	Although Dyen (1978:392) was doubtful about the classification of this speech
	community, it can be demonstrated that Piru is a dialect of Luhu, a fact which
	Van Hoevell correctly stated in 1877. For a variety of historical and social
	reasons (outlined in Collins 1983b), the language of Piru has undergone a number
	of irregular changes and now it is close to extinction. The most striking
	differences between Luhu and Piru are the loss of almost all productive verbal
	conjugations in the latter dialect and the sporadic influence of East Piru Bay
	languages and, perhaps, Alune. This is especially apparent in the numerous loan
	words which have slipped into Piru, apparently
	
	via Eti, a Kaibobo-speaking village a few kilometers southward on the east shore
	of the bay. A few unexpected sound correspondences may also be attributed to
	Eti.” (Collins1982)
	
	“As noted 20 years ago (Collins 1983), Piru is closely related to the language
	of Luhu. Moreover, Sachse (1919:44) considered Piru and Luhu the two dialects of
	‘Behasa Loehoe’. In fact, Piru probably represents the northernmost point in the
	chain of Luhu-speaking villages that spread across the whole Hoamoal peninsula
	before 1650 (footnote 19 - Payapo’s map (1980:62-3) suggests just this kind of
	isolation of Piru, with non-Luhu- speaking villages, such as Ariate and Talaga,
	intervening between the main Luhu-speaking areas to the south and Piru, which
	Payapo also labeled as Luhu-speaking.) When De Valming’s forced resettlement
	policy depopulated the peninsula, the links in that chain were broken, leaving
	Piru speakers isolated from Luhu speakers, especially those remaining in Luhu
	itself...The borrowing of vocabulary, especially from Eti, a village which
	traditionally spoke and East Piru Bay language related to Kaibobo, but also
	lexical items from nearby Alune speaking villages, has made Piru diverge from
	contemporary Luhu. However, the relationship of Piru with Luhu is striking,
	(footnote 20 – Taguchi (1989:49) apparently did
	
	not understand the argumentation inf Collins (1983:79-81). In those pages, Piru
	and Luhu are considered variants (dialects) of the same Luhu language because
	they share phonological innovations, not because there is a tradition that
	Hoamoal formed a single language. His untested assertion that these two ‘speech
	forms are probably not mutually intelligable’ is unlikely to be true. His
	informant, aged only 45 might, might perhaps experience difficulty, but speakers
	of Luhu would find Piru (if it was ever spoken in public) easy to understand.
	With no data from either of the Luhu or Piru wordlists used by Taguchi, it is
	difficult to understand where he sees the problem in intelligibility. Note that
	Payapo (1980), a speaker of Luhu, considered Piru a variant of Luhu. The reader
	can refer to the brief comparative wordlist, based on Collins(1977-79), found in
	Appendix 1 here to form his or her own opinion about the extent of differences
	between Piru and Luhu.) even to the point of both variants displaying mundai
	‘man, male’ and sima ‘who’, found in no other
	
	West Piru Bay languages – except Batumerah, as noted above.” (Collins 2003)

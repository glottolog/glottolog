[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Kofa [kso] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 as a separate language, with the comment that it is ``Reportedly a separate language from Bura-Pabir
	[bwr]''. It is correct that it is distinct from Bura-Pabir [bwr] but already **hh:hew:Meek:Tribal:I**:118-121 had data from Kofa and shows that they speak the same language as Malabu, i.e., Bata [bta]. See also: Bata [bta], Bura-Pabir [bwr].

comment = The Musi river is the longest in Sumatra, and many speech varieties are spoken
	along its length. Musi and the other Malay varieties listed in 4a were listed in
	the 1981 Wurm and Hattori linguistic atlas as being Malay dialects, but were
	incorrectly interpreted in previous Ethnologue editions as distinct languages.
	Language surveys completed in 2006-2007 found comprehension between these Malay
	dialects, and a set of shared phonological innovations. The above "languages"
	should be listed as dialects of Musi.
	
	MUSI--language (internal structure) Musi group Palembang group
	
	Musi, Rawas, Pegagan Palembang, Lowland Malay
	
	It was found that there was high reported comprehension between the speech
	varieties found along the coastal plain of South Sumatra and those centered
	around the city of Palembang, making a Palembang subgroup. The speech varieties
	of Downstream Lematang, Belide, and Penesak also had a high rate of reported
	comprehension, and form a Lowland Malay subgroup. The Palembang and the Lowland
	Malay subdialects together form the Palembang Malay subgroup of the Musi
	language. The other subgroup in the Musi language is the Musi subgroup, which is
	comprised of the Musi, Pegagan, and Rawas dialects. The Musi and Pegagan speech
	varieties share phonological innovations. Rawas has one of the phonological
	innovations, as well as some of its own. There is high reported comprehension
	between the Musi and Rawas and a high percentage of shared lexical items. The
	culture, phonological innovations, and reported comprehension in the Musi river
	basin dialect chain provide a reasonable basis for grouping these dialects of
	Malay (as ) as a distinct language. Moreover, the cultural and linguistic
	differences, distinct phonological innovations, along with lower reported
	comprehension between isolects of the Musi language and those of Central Malay
	(Pasemah, Semendo, Enim, etc.) argue against subsuming them all under "South
	Sumatran Malay".

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = E16/E17 has two entries in its Northern Kuki-Chin subgroup Purum Naga [puz] (in India) and Purum [pub] (across the border in Burma). Not surprisingly, they are the same language and were recognized as such (**hh:hvw:Grierson:3:III**:263) before the British empire was split up. See also: Purum [pub].

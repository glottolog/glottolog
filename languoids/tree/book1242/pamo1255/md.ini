comment = In 1908, the Dutch administrator O. E. Goedhart visited Batui. In a somewhat
	odd-seeming practice today, he named the people’s speech the ‘Baha language’
	after their negative term. In this he was partly in error, because the word for
	‘no’ in Batui is actually mbaha’. In 1914, the Dutch linguist N. Adriani further
	compounded the error by surmising that Baha must be a dialect of the nearby
	Pamona language. Adriani's basis was (a) geographical proximity, and (b) that
	the negative term "baha" superficially resembled "bare'e" of the Pamona
	language.
	
	Sadly, no one bothered to check things out further. Instead, as the years
	passed, the claim was repeated on language atlases and other writings about
	Sulawesi languages. People forgot about the shaky foundation upon which it had
	been built, and thus error had become "linguistic fact".
	
	In 2006 we collected (in fact, became the first to collect) first-hand
	information on the Batui language, and discovered that Batui is not even closely
	related to Pamona at all, but shares its greatest affinities with the
	Saluan-Banggai languages to the east. Including Batui (or Baha) as a dialect of
	Pamona was nothing other than an egregious error.

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Kuku-Mangk [xmq] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 as an extinct separate Middle Paman language. However, out only information regarding Kuku-Mangk
	(**hh:he:vonSturmer:Wik**:171-172,
	**hh:hvsoc:Sutton:Wik-Relationships**:168-171,
	**hh:g:SmithJohnson:Nganhcara**:358-361) says that some informants equate it with Kugu Iiyanh [wij] while others ascribe it a separate identity. But even if the informants giving it a separate identity are correct, they do not necessarily mean that Kuku-Mangk is not intelligible to Kugu Iiyanh or any of the other Kugu dialects. No form-meaning pairs are available to ascertain any variant of the relationship, and thus there is insufficient basis for ascertaining that Kugu-Mangk [xmq] should be a separate entry. See also: Wik-Iiyanh [wij].

[hh_ethnologue_comment]
comment = Kuku-Mangk [xmq] is listed in E16/E17/E18/E19 as an extinct separate Middle
	Paman language. However, out only information regarding Kuku-Mangk
	(**hh:he:vonSturmer:Wik**:171-172,
	**hh:hvsoc:Sutton:Wik-Relationships**:168-171,
	**hh:g:SmithJohnson:Nganhcara**:358-361) says that some informants equate it
	with Kugu Iiyanh [wij] while others ascribe it a separate identity. But even if
	the informants giving it a separate identity are correct, they do not
	necessarily mean that Kuku-Mangk is not intelligible to Kugu Iiyanh or any of
	the other Kugu dialects. No form-meaning pairs are available to ascertain any
	variant of the relationship, and thus there is insufficient basis for
	ascertaining that Kugu-Mangk [xmq] should be a separate entry. See also:
	Wik-Iiyanh [wij].

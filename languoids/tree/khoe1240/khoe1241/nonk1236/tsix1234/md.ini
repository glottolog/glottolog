comment = Ts'ixa (4570) = Endangered (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (The Ts’ixa language is threatened as many children receive their formal education in boarding schools, in which they are alienated, not only to their environment and culture, but also to their language. Many young Ts’ixa feel more comfortable in speaking Setswana and English, i.e. the languages they are educated in, than in their heritage language.)

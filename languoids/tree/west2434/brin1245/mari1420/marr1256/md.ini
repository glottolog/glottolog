comment = Marriammu (2329-xru) = Critically Endangered (60 percent certain, based on the evidence available) (Only a handful of elderly Marriammu people are strong speakers of the language, while the younger ones are talking the traditional language of Wadeye, Murrinh Patha. Many younger Marriammu people understand the language but cannot speak it. They are able to sing the ceremonial songs in Marriammu but very little else. One of the younger people I spoke to listens very carefully to his mother speaking Marriammu and is taking an interest in trying to learn to speak the language. [...] As far as the informants or anyone else is aware of, there are no children speaking the Marriammu language.) [Brown 1999](elcat:cc18d3b2397eccbf04591b5b99dcc377)

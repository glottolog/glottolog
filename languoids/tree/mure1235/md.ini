[classification]
family = The text analysis of Mure by **hh:hvw:deCrequiMontfortRivet:Capakura** is sound,
	but the parallels with Chapacuran are limited to a few words, while the rest it
	utterly different. Therefore, the near-identical Chapacuran words are likely to
	be loans, especially given that the Mure were missioned together with Chapacuran
	peoples. No other relation for the Mure data has been suggested or is apparent.

comment = Mure, an extinct Bolivian language of uncertain affiliation attested only with
	the Pater Noster in **hh:h:Teza:Americane** and a few sporadic mentions
	(**hh:hv:Hervas:Americanas**:251, **hh:h:Bueno:Obispado-Santa-Cruz**), is
	missing from E16/E17/E18/E19. It is not to be confused with the more well-known
	Chapacuran Bolivian language called Moré or Itene [ite]
	(**hh:g:Angenot-de-Lima:More**). See also: Itene [ite].

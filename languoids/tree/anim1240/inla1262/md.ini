[classification]
family = Internally, the membership of the geographically non-adjacent Ipikoi in the
	family was realised only in the early 1970s (**hh:hv:Franklin:Other**):267-273.
	Evidence for a Trans New Guinea membership are the singular pronouns in the
	Minanibai branch and a few lexical items (**hh:hvld:Wurm:ECTNG**):509-510 and
	**21928(**):152, 157 takes the pronoun evidence to be probative. However, the
	pronouns which look most like Trans New Guinea have not yet been shown to go
	back to proto-Inland Gulf, and even if we assume they are characteristic, the
	total of the evidence for a Trans New Guinea affiliation is very slight.
	Therefore, it would be premature to call Inland Gulf a branch of the Trans New
	Guinea family. No stronger cases for Inland Gulf affiliations to other
	(sub-)families have been put forward.
